# knowledge

Watershed-group fisheries background for British Columbia: the past-report corpus (EcoCat
harvest → Zotero → ragnar store → content tags), provincial fish records (FISS data submissions
and the FDIS electrofishing export), the cited habitat literature, and the habitat thresholds
tested against them. The unit of work is the **watershed group**; downstream report and model
repos consume snapshots from here instead of carrying the pipeline.

## Repository Context

**Repository:** NewGraphEnvironment/knowledge, public since 2026-11-01 (#56); the pkgdown site is
<https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/knowledge/>, where newgraphenvironment.github.io/knowledge/ redirects
**Primary Language:** R, with Python (`0153`, `0270`) and workflow JS (`wf_*.js`)
**Origin:** seeded in September 2026 with history from an earlier fish-passage reporting template.
Issue and PR numbers in the seeded history and in `planning/archive/2026-07-*` refer to that repo.

## Layout

- `R/`, `man/`, `tests/` at the root — R package `knowledge` (`pak::pak("NewGraphEnvironment/knowledge")`).
  Only code that has run on two regions graduates here. `.Rbuildignore` keeps `data/`, `scripts/`,
  `planning/` and `research/` out of the build, and `tests/testthat/test-data-dir.R` keeps `.R` and
  `.rda` files off the top of `data/`, where `pkgload::load_all()` would source or load them.
- `vignettes/chinook_rearing.Rmd` — the pkgdown article on the chinook rearing threshold (#62). It reads
  `inst/vignette-data/`, which `data-raw/vignette_chinook.R` writes from the tune and compare tables and the
  database (`SCHEMA` names the run's schema, as `0320` and `0330` take it). A promotion (`0335`) reruns it, and only a
  promotion changes its sources, because `tests/testthat/test-vignette-data.R` fails when a tracked source's md5 moves
  (#111). It takes the tuning log of the run its CH rearing summary names (`tune_run`), not the newest. Every number in its prose is computed inline from those files. Its references
  are `vignettes/chinook_rearing.bib`, which `data-raw/vignette_bib.R` writes from the group library through Better
  BibTeX (Zotero must be running): rerun it after any citation change. It refuses a key Zotero does not return, strips
  each entry's local attachment path, and sets software versions from the run's ledger, one token each, because
  citeproc prints a version with a space as "Versions …". Its map is interactive only when pkgdown builds the site
  (`IN_PKGDOWN`), on Esri's World Topographic Map. Check a cited
  claim against the PDF's text: cred's `crd_aud_verify_all()` cuts each claim at the Rmd's line breaks and matches
  unrelated passages (#79).
- `vignettes/habitat_thresholds.Rmd` — the methodology article (#93), "Choosing habitat thresholds from where fish were
  caught": the reference home for the method and its citations. A species article (the chinook one first, #64) gives
  its own records and result in a sentence or two and links it rather than restating the method. It reads `inst/vignette-data/method.rds`, which `data-raw/vignette_method.R` writes from
  `inst/method/pipeline.csv` (the steps) and `inst/method/settings.csv` (every number that shapes a result, with where
  its value lives); the script refuses to run with its code or registers uncommitted. A promotion reruns it, last; it
  reads the ledger the published tables name (`knw_run_ledger()`), and refuses on a machine whose `data/fdis/derived`
  is not that build's evidence. `tests/testthat/test-settings-register.R` fails when a register value and the code
  disagree: change both together, and add a row for any new number that shapes a result (the test cannot see one with
  no row). `method.rds` pins each grade table's tracked record (`data/tune/<key>_grades_record.csv`), not the table
  (#119), and the md5s of the ignored evidence it was built from, which `test-vignette-data.R` checks wherever they
  exist, so on a machine whose copies differ it fails there and nowhere else (CI has no `data/`). A checkout without
  them restores them with `PULL=TRUE scripts/0336-archive.R`, the run its records name. Its references come from `data-raw/vignette_bib.R` with the chinook article's. A draft article is named
  `vignettes/_<name>.Rmd`: pkgdown skips it, `.Rbuildignore` keeps it out of the tarball, and pkgdown.yaml fails if
  one reaches `docs/articles/`.
- `scripts/` — the run order (`scripts/README.md`), calling the package (`pkgload::load_all()` from
  the root) and `cred`. Legacy literals in scripts are fixed forward as they are touched.
- `data/<wsg>/` — per-group snapshots (csv/md) and small spatial deliverables (gpkg/kml). Tracked.
- `data/` root — cross-group tier: `corpus_tags.csv`, `priority_farmed_all.csv`,
  `zotero_key_map.csv`, `rag_priorities.{gpkg,kml}`, `fdis_repeat_surveys.csv` (FDIS copies `0230` drops, #35), `life_history_timing.csv` (seeded by `0260`,
  then hand-edited; read with `knw_timing_read()`), `literature_evidence.csv` (cited habitat-threshold
  values with verbatim quotes, read with `knw_literature_read()`, gated by `0280`; a row stating an
  intrinsic-potential model's threshold carries that model's `model_id`; a temperature, air-temperature or
  degree-day value names its `metric`; a `fish_length` row is a body length tied to first-winter survival, in `mm`, whose `metric` names the length type (#47); a `groundwater` row is a statement with no value; `discharge` is stream
  size and `instream_flow` a flow need: a valued one names its `metric`, and none carries a model parameter),
  `ip_model_registry.csv` (one row
  per IP model × species × stage: how it sizes streams, its confinement variable, its validation, with its
  flow claim and any validation claimed each quoted; read with `knw_ip_read()`, gated and link-checked by
  `0280`),
  `bt_rear_use_curve.csv` and `habitat_weight_bt_rear.csv` (BT rearing use by gradient class from FDIS
  visits on link's segments, and the candidate weight per class; `0290`-`0292`, `research/habitat_weights.md`),
  `bt_spawn_evidence.csv` (BT spawner-evidence rates by gradient class; `0293`, `research/bt_spawning.md`),
  `ch_mad_use.csv` (CH detection by wet's MAD class and, on small streams, by distance to a large river,
  from FDIS visits; `0294`-`0295`, `research/chinook_stream_size.md`),
  `ch_rule_{tune,curves,flips,compare,checks,change}.csv` (the tuned CH rearing rule: every rule's held-out
  score on the main reading, with each other reading's region and picks, the GAM curves, flow-source flips, and the rule beside `default` on link's segments; `0296`-`0298`,
  `research/chinook_rearing_tuned.md`),
  and
  `habitat_modelling_{members,additions}.csv` (what `0270` puts in the group's `Fisheries/habitat_modelling`
  collection, which with the species collections feeds the `habitat_modelling` store), and
  `temperature_{members,additions}.csv` (what `0270 --collection temperature` puts in `Fisheries/temperature`, the sole
  input of the `temperature` store), and `flow_{members,additions}.csv` (what `0270 --collection flow` puts in
  `Fisheries/flow`, the sole input of the `flow` store; #44, `research/flow_requirements.md`), and
  `bull_trout_members.csv`, `grayling_{members,additions}.csv` (what `0270 --collection <name> --parent 9U54XAND`
  puts in `species/bull_trout` and `species/grayling`, the inputs of the `bull_trout_grayling` store; hand-curated
  collections, so the files list what the cleanup ensured, and 0270 never removes a member; #122), and
  `thresholds.csv` and `thresholds_groups.csv` (the tuned thresholds per species × stage × component in link's
  parameter names, with the near-river pair's scope where a rule has one (`near_river_scope`, from the comparison's
  tuned structure), and the groups each rule was scored on; `0325`, #57, #73). `data/tune/` holds the tuning run's
  per-rule scores and curves (its grade tables and fitted curves are ignored; each grade table's record,
  `<key>_grades_record.csv`, is tracked, and `0336` keeps the tables in the bucket's private `archive/knowledge/`, with
  `data/archive_index.csv` saying where, #119, `research/run_archive.md`), `data/compare/` the comparison
  tables (its catalog cache and interactive maps ignored), `data/publish/` the Parquet sets (ignored).
  `data/tune/grad_ext/` and `data/compare/grad_ext/` hold `0322`'s CH rearing run on a gradient ladder extended to
  30 % (#67, on the evidence build before #73; the main run carries that ladder for every species since #68);
  `0325`, `0330` and `knw_thresholds_table()` do not read them, because they list their directories non-recursively;
  `data-raw/vignette_chinook.R` reads `data/tune/grad_ext/` for the chinook article's sentence on the longer ladder. `data/compare/gpkg/` (ignored) holds one GeoPackage per species × stage from `0330`, the
  comparison's view for QGIS (#81). `data/tune/candidate/<run>/` and `data/compare/candidate/<run>/` (ignored, #111)
  hold the full runs of `0320` and `0330` until `0335` promotes one, and the `replaced_<stamp>/` archive of what each
  promotion replaced (promoting it undoes the promotion); `data/tune/dev/` (ignored) holds `DEV=1 0320`, its log and
  its `pick_report.csv`. The tracked tables change only by promotion.
- `data/rag/` — ignored local cache of the ragnar stores. Source of truth is `s3://fresh-bc/rag/` (not public).
- `data/fdis/` — ignored cache of the FDIS export (`0230` syncs it) and of the visit tables built from it
  (`data/fdis/derived/`; `0299` builds them as `knowledge/fdis/v3`, which is not yet uploaded (`v2` is the
  newest published set, measured 2026-10-20). `PULL=TRUE` restores a published version, so today only with
  `VERSION=v2`, the pre-#57 set that `0291`–`0298` read).

## One discipline: everything here is public

The watershed group is an argument, never a project or a client. Nothing tracked here, and no
issue, PR or commit message, carries client or project identifiers, host or machine names,
database hosts, ports or logins, credential file paths, password-manager references, or links to
private repositories. This file is held to all of it. `planning/` is a record of the work and may
name what was removed, hosts and our other repositories included, but from 2026-10-16 it carries no
client or project identifiers and no home paths; the `planning/archive/` and `scripts/logs/` written
before then are left as they were. Context that needs any of them belongs in a private coordination
repo, not here. Credentials come from the environment (`PG*`, `ZOTERO_API_KEY`, AWS). The #56
archive's `public_sweep.py` is the check: it searches tracked files outside `planning/archive/` and
`scripts/logs/` (`planning/active/` for client slugs and local paths only), issue and PR text,
retitles and a branch's commit messages, and with `history` every earlier revision GitHub keeps.
Its patterns are a list, not the class: a new kind of identifier needs a new pattern.

Tracked data from other sources carries their terms, and `inst/NOTICE.md` lists each source with its files (it
installs with the package because `inst/vignette-data/` ships Freshwater Atlas geometry). A new tracked source
gets its row there, its licence read from the source's own catalogue record; one whose terms are unconfirmed goes
to an issue instead. The PSCIS layers are "Access Only" in the BC Data Catalogue; their snapshots stay tracked as
incidental working copies (Al, 2026-11-01). The EcoCat-derived tables and the bcfishpass-derived files (bcfishpass's
database is ODbL, share-alike) are still #76: the repo went public with them open, on Al's word (2026-11-01).

## Working notes

### Ragnar stores live in S3 through `cred`; a local ingest must be pushed

`.Rprofile` sets `options(cred.store_source = "s3://fresh-bc/rag/")` (committed there so it travels
with the repo; a project `.Renviron` would replace the user's, see Database access). A project `.Rprofile` replaces
`~/.Rprofile` the same way, so ours sources it first: on CI that file holds the Posit binary repository `setup-r` writes, and
without it every package built from CRAN source (#94). `cred::crd_store_connect("<store>")` pulls
and md5-verifies; `cred::crd_store_push()` uploads and merges the `log.json` manifest. After a
local write (`0152` ingest, `0156` dedup) the local md5 no longer matches the manifest, and the
next `verify = TRUE` connect **replaces the local file with the bucket copy**. Push first.

`crd_store_build()` reads the local `~/Zotero/zotero.sqlite` and names documents by Better BibTeX
citation key. That is a different identity from the harvest's `<EXTENT>__<reportId>.pdf`, which
`0152`–`0156` parse out of `origin` for watershed-group attribution. A key-named store needs
`data/zotero_key_map.csv` to join the farm. `peace.duckdb` is key-named and never deduped; the
manifest entry says so.

### Read `zotero.sqlite` from a guarded copy while Zotero runs

Under its old rollback journal Zotero held the file in exclusive locking mode, so a normal
read-only connection blocked and an `immutable=1` read taken during a sync could fail with
"database disk image is malformed" or see half a transaction (hit on every member right after
`0270`'s own writes started a sync). Since Zotero 10 the file is in WAL mode (header bytes 18-19
`02 02`; a plain read-only connection did not block on 2026-10-31, but the readers still copy,
which keeps them off the live files in either mode): a commit sits in
`zotero.sqlite-wal` until a checkpoint folds it into the main file, so a copy of the main file
alone, like an `immutable=1` read, opens, passes `quick_check` and silently misses it, and a sync
moves the `-wal`'s mtime while the main file's stays put (#127). `0270`'s `db()`, `0280`'s
`snapshot()` and `0150`'s copy of it (read by `collection_keys()`) copy the main file with its
`-wal` (not the `-shm`, which SQLite rebuilds) and keep the pair only when both files' mtime and
size and the header's journal mode are unchanged across the copy, no rollback journal is open,
and the copy opens and passes `quick_check`. The header change counter is no guard: SQLite did
not bump it per commit in Zotero's exclusive mode, and need not in WAL mode.
`data-raw/zotero_copy_check.R` runs the three on fixtures whose `-wal` holds rows the main file
lacks; what each piece of the guard is for, measured by removing it, is
`research/zotero_database.md`. cred still reads immutable
(NewGraphEnvironment/cred#45), so an `0150 ACTION=build` can miss what Zotero has not yet
checkpointed. Citation keys are not unique across libraries (the same key names different
papers in the personal and group libraries), so resolve a key inside the group
(`groups.groupID = 4733734`), never across the whole database.

`0150 ACTION=query` needs cred 0.4.0 or later: 0.3.0's `crd_search()` failed on every store under ragnar 0.3.0
(NewGraphEnvironment/cred#27); under 0.4.0 it returns hybrid results (2026-10-30), and `0150` refuses an older cred.
`ACTION=build` needs cred 0.5.0, the first that resolves a key inside one library, skips the trash and ingests every
live PDF of an item (NewGraphEnvironment/cred#40); `0150` passes the group as `library` and refuses an older cred.

### An EcoCat report is several documents

3 to 19 per report. The harvest workflows take only the first PDF, so the store holds one
document's text per report and the first PDF is not always the main report. `0153` files all of
them to Zotero. Widening the harvest is open work.

### Reconcile per crossing, not per report

A report spans several watershed groups but the harvest tags one extent. `0161` reconciles against
the union of all groups' crossings and stamps the true group. Road-deactivation and riparian
tables use the same high/moderate wording as fish-passage priorities — filter by `table_source`.
Recon reports number reaches 1, 2, 3; those are not crossing ids.

### Don't harvest NGE's own reports from EcoCat

They are the stale submitted versions. They reach Zotero from the report repos.

### Zotero access is local, except for filing

Store builds read `~/Zotero/zotero.sqlite` read-only, so they need a synced Zotero data directory
and no key. `0153` and `0270` write to the group library through the Web API with the key in
`ZOTERO_API_KEY`, and exit at once when it is unset or empty, because an empty key otherwise
reads as a JSON parse error three calls later. Items `0270` creates through the Web API sync and
get Better BibTeX keys without a Zotero restart (measured 2026-10-02), so `0270` → `0150` build →
`0280` runs end to end in one sitting, except that the build's cred reads miss what Zotero has not
checkpointed (NewGraphEnvironment/cred#45): `0150` warns when the `-wal` is not empty.

A build's "Skipping missing file" for a key can mean its attachment never got a file while a
duplicate item (same DOI) holds the PDF: Opperman et al. 2010 sat that way through two builds. Search
the group by DOI before chasing the paper; the Web API's `/items` omits trashed items, so a trashed
copy shows only as a parent key. Merge through the Web API (PATCH the attachment's `parentItem`, the
kept item's `collections` and `relations: {"dc:replaces": [...]}`, then `deleted: 1` on the duplicate
and the empty attachment). The document joins a store only at its next full build until cred can
update one in place (NewGraphEnvironment/cred#44).

### The FDIS electrofishing export: public as received, and richer than the public layers

`s3://fresh-bc/fdis/` holds province-wide FDIS extracts the Province supplied for the 2021–22
channel-width work (exports of 2020-11-16 and 2022-03-22; `MANIFEST.md5`). The Province agreed on
2026-10-16 to their publication provided they carry a note of when and from where they were
received: that note is `fdis/README.md`, whose source is `data/fdis_README.md`, so edit it there
and publish with `0299`. Nothing that is not part of the extract goes under `fdis/`, because the
whole prefix is public; working files go to the bucket's private `archive/`. The visit tables built
from it are published under `knowledge/fdis/v2/` (a change of columns or meaning is a new version;
v1 predates #35).
It is electrofishing only.
The 2022 `Details*` files contain every 2020 fish row, and exact duplicate rows are distinct fish.
`counts` is the abundance table; `details` is a length subsample. `scripts/0230`–`0240` build
from it, and `research/fdis_export.md` is the reference. The FWA "field measurement" channel
widths are these same sites, so never score the width model against them.
Some surveys were loaded under two to four collection ids (same UTM, date, per-pass effort and
catch). `0230` keeps one copy, the one with the most measured fish, because the fish often sit on
the later id only, and lists the rest in `data/fdis_repeat_surveys.csv` (#35). Downstream scripts
carry no duplicate logic of their own.

`0230` places a visit with `fresh::frs_point_snap()` twice (#91): to the nearest stream, and to each 20k stream its
FDIS 1:50k code names (`fwa_streams_20k_50k`), passed as a per-point hint so that snap lands only on that stream.
`knw_fdis_place()` takes the nearest named stream in reach ("confirmed", moved past a nearer stream where need be),
else the nearest one, and holds the two kinds of pick to their own limits (`snap_limit`, `snap_limit_code`;
`research/fdis_export.md`, "Placement"). "Confirmed" means on some stream the code names, which for a code naming
several keys is not necessarily the one the surveyor meant. fresh never snaps to an unmapped or placeholder line, so
the visits `fwa_indexpoint()` put on one, which link's segments lack, now reach a mapped stream. The FISS workbook
sites (`0250`) still snap with `fwa_indexpoint()` and a 100 m flag, so `flag_far_snap` means two things in the
bound `fdis_evidence.csv` and `fiss_evidence.csv`. `0310` takes `SCHEMA` and caches its visit walks in
`knw.walk_cache` from #91.

From #57, `0310` builds every species' visit table on the province-wide
`fresh_default` in one pass and `0290`, `0294` and `0296` write their tables from it; `0291`–`0298` are frozen on
the published v2 tables (`0299 PULL=TRUE VERSION=v2`).

### The tuning scores link's segment gradient, and link cuts a segment where its species were caught

From #92, rules and curves read `segment_gradient`, the gradient of the link segment a visit sits on, which is the one
link applies a rule to and the grade reads; `fwa_gradient` (the whole Atlas line's) is the sensitivity
(`GRADIENT=fwa_gradient 0320`, main fold seed, `data/tune/grad_fwa/`, never graded, and read by no publisher: `0325`,
`0330` and `knw_thresholds_table()` list `data/tune/` without recursing; `data-raw/vignette_method.R` reads it for the
methodology article's sensitivity sentence).
`knw_grade_species()` refuses a curve fitted on any other gradient. link breaks streams at the bcfishobs observations
of the species it models in each group, and an FDIS visit that caught one is usually such an observation, so the
segment and its length depend on the outcome: on the tuning's stream branch 86 % of visits with fish start a segment of
their own against 10 % of empty ones, with median lengths of 113 m and 305 m. By any catch the gradient's gap from the
Atlas line's does not (median 0.0083 either way), but by each species' own outcome it is smaller where the species was
present for CO, GR, ST and WCT (WCT 0.0076 against 0.0164; `data-raw/segment_gradient_check.R`). Fixed-window gradients, whose length would
not depend on the outcome, are #70's. These numbers, and #92's tune, are on link 0.66.0's build
(`fresh_default_20261017`). link has since cut gradient breaks only where a present species' access changes
(link#326, 0.69.0) and fish records only at each species' highest record per stream (link#396), and no build in the
database carried either on 2026-10-28.

### FISS submission workbooks: editions drift, and most EF fish are already in FDIS

Template editions before 2016 name columns differently (`species_code`, `method`,
`haul_or_pass`, `date_yyyy_mm_day`). Any new column `0220` reads needs checking against every
edition's header, or it silently comes back NA on the old ones. A site is no-fish only if no
Step 2 record under its reference number caught anything: one trap with fish makes it a fish
site. `NFC` and "No Fish Caught" are the no-fish entries (confirmed with Al, 2026-09-28). The
FDIS export was built from these submissions, so `0250` dedupes against it before counting
anything as new. The harvest records no submitter, so NGE-authored workbooks cannot be picked
out. `research/fdis_export.md` has the overlap figures.

### Drafting evidence or registry rows: the gate checks words, not meaning

`0280` proves a quote is verbatim in its PDF and a value sits in its quote. It cannot see a row that says
the wrong thing around a true quote. On #29, every quote verified and a full row-by-row audit against the
PDFs still found 22 errors of meaning over three rounds, several of them inside earlier fixes. Audit
meaning per row, not a sample. Settled conventions:
- `validation` is a comparison with fish records the model was not fitted to; one that set the model's
  classes is calibration (`none`).
- An interior curve breakpoint (a non-zero score, a curve switch) has a blank `bound`; `min`/`max` is a
  limit or a zero-suitability edge.
- A source that names a stream-size variable but not how it was obtained is `flow_source = unstated`.
- A temperature value whose source does not name the statistic is `metric = unstated`; never infer one. An
  air temperature, including a model's air proxy for water, is `air_temperature`. A degree-day row's note
  gives its base temperature. `species_code` is the species measured: Colorado River cutthroat (Coleman &
  Fausch 2007, the `gsdd` growing season) is `CRCT`, not `WCT` (#38).
- A flow need is `instream_flow`; a MAD that sizes a stream is `discharge` (#44). A need's `metric` is the flow
  statistic it is held to (`unstated` if the source does not say), and its unit is as written: `percent MAD`,
  a `percentile` (90th is high) or a `percent exceedance` (Q95 is low); never convert. Depth and velocity are
  what a fish meets at a site, in the unit the source wrote; a bankfull depth is `m bankfull`. An optimum
  (a WUA peak, Tennant's optimum range) is `bound = optimum`, never `range`. A standard that names no species
  is coded for the scope it states, `FISH`, `SALMON` or `SALMONIDS` (Al, 2026-10-07), one row per statement and
  stage, not one per species, and fills no grid cell.
- `kind = lab` is a laboratory or hatchery measurement (UILT, CTmax, survival at a held temperature,
  development in thermal units); `expert` is a recommendation or criterion. Rows from one table or page are
  coded alike unless the note says why, and the source decides, not a sibling row: #38's round-2 audit found
  a round-1 fix that had recoded Sauter Table 4 from a neighbouring row when the paper calls it observed
  temperatures (`dist`).
- A convention a drafter brief sets is a claim about a source, so check it against the source like a row: #44's
  brief coded Tennant's flows `seasonal_mean` and 14 rows inherited it, though Tennant asks for instantaneous
  flows. And a note gives each statement its own page and sentence: all seven errors that #44's audits found
  inside earlier fixes merged two near-identical statements into one parenthesis (a text's edges and a figure's,
  a review's row and the original's). Read the original, not a review that restates it, wherever both are held:
  Ford et al. 1995 misstated five values its originals print differently.
- When a report and its paper publish one study, read each figure's data (its point count against the stated design,
  its coefficients) before saying which values the two share. #40 applied the report's methods sentence ("only the
  third experiment is reported") to every result, and four audit rounds each found an error inside the previous fix
  until an enumeration of every note sentence ended it. A growth optimum the source measured at held temperatures
  is `kind = lab`; one a source states or reviews is `pref`.
- A first-winter size threshold is a `fish_length` row with the length type the source measured (`total_length`,
  `fork_length`, or `unstated`); a conversion the source prints (30–35 mm TL as 28–33 mm FL) is a second row. A
  relation with no threshold (survival on fall length, length on GSDD) is a `qual` row with the equation in the note,
  never solved for a value the source does not print. `growing_season` is only Coleman & Fausch's window; a
  degree-day sum on any other window the vocabulary lacks (Holtby's February–March thermal summation) is `unstated`
  with the window in the note (#47).
- Where a paper cannot be had, a row may quote its publisher abstract: `quote_source = abstract`, no page, checked
  against the Zotero item's abstract (`0270` takes it from CrossRef for an additions row with `pdf = none`; never
  typed by hand). It says only what the abstract says, so a length type the abstract omits is `unstated`, and its
  note opens "Abstract only". `0280` refuses it once the item has a PDF: re-quote it from the paper then (#48).
- Append new rows; never insert. `research/` files cite evidence by data row, and data row N is file line
  N + 1 (#36's plan named file lines and called them data rows). A statement that bears on two variables is
  two rows sharing one quote, each noting the other. Copy a sibling's fields only after checking them: #36
  copied a wrong `region` from a sibling and fixed all three rows that share the sentence.

The #29 archive holds the drafter brief and the two helper scripts (`scratch_keytext.py` extracts a
group-library key's PDF text; `scratch_merge_drafts.py` merges family drafts onto the committed tables).

### Reading use against link's segments: `access_bt = 2` is circular

link codes a segment `access_bt = 2` when a BT observation sits upstream. Those observations are mostly
FDIS records, the same visits an FDIS use analysis counts. A visit that caught BT therefore tends to
put its own segment in code 2: on steep segments, 68 % of BT-caught visits against 2.6 % of the rest.
Keep code 2 in the population, but never use it as a covariate, a stratum, or evidence about where BT
live. #28 used it as evidence once, after the plan review had flagged it (archive
`2026-10-issue-28-habitat-weights`). link segments also overlap by up to ~1.4 mm at breaks, so a
point join needs a deterministic tiebreak (`0290`).

### link's access: gate on `streams_access`, not the habitat tables' `accessible`

`streams_habitat_<sp>.accessible` and `streams_access.access_<sp>` disagree in link's `default` builds, and did before
the province-wide run: about 2 % of habitat-accessible segments for most species, 17–27 % for RB and 90 % for KO, with
rearing and spawning set on segments `streams_access` blocks (NewGraphEnvironment/link#349, cause not established).
Gate on `streams_access`, as `0290` does with `access_bt`, re-gate the habitat flags on it, and record the
cross-tabulation per species with each build (#57).

### link's CH rearing: regenerate it, never compare to the stored flags

`default`'s CH rearing has three stages:
1. fresh's predicate (`fresh::frs_habitat_predicates()` on link's `configs/default`), gated by access;
2. the user-habitat overlay;
3. `.frs_run_connectivity()`, which drops rearing clusters with no spawning within 10 km.

`fresh_default.log` has no rows for the 31 CH groups, and a regeneration differs from their stored flags on 4,584 km.
So compare rules regenerated through all three stages on scratch copies (`0298`), never against the stored flags.

Width and flow carry two traps (#54):
- **Widths.** fwapg models width only where `stream_order > 1`, and its FIELD_MEASURMENT widths are FDIS sites. An
  order-1 stream therefore has a width only where it was measured. A width rule scored at visits sees widths link
  never sees on unmeasured streams; use `0296`'s `cw_deploy`.
- **Flow on river polygons.** Connector lines inside river polygons (edge 1450) carry their tributary's small wet
  flow, and the main lines (1250) of some small double-line rivers carry a small flow of their own. At `default`'s gradient, a 0.75 m³/s
  floor on the river branch drops 636 km of edge 1450, 1250 and 1350 lines in the 31 groups.

### link's parity reference is its `bcfishpass` config, not `default`

`default` is the bundle knowledge tunes against, not a copy of bcfishpass, so never argue for or against changing it on
parity grounds. `default` reads fwapg's annual flow table (`fwa_stream_networks_discharge`) until `default_tuned`, which
reads wet (link#331), has been reviewed; moving `default` to MAD in every group is planned and will be done
deliberately, not as a side effect (Al, 2026-10-27). A MAD `default` must read wet: fwapg's table covers only the
Fraser, Peace and Columbia and skips order-8+ mainstems (`research/modelled_discharge.md`).

### Reading the tuning's stability checks: say what each one counts

The checks answer different questions, and #67's article needed four review rounds to stop quoting them past what
they show:
- **Exact rule or component.** `seeds_same_rec` and a rule's `boot_rec_share` in `<key>_tune.csv` count the exact rule;
  `boot_rec_share` in `grad_ext/<key>_by_grad.csv` counts any rule at that gradient. On #67's 30 % ladder the exact
  15 % rule came back on 0 of 4 seeds while all 4 picked a 15 % limit, and the published 9 % rule was itself the
  exact pick on 0 of 4.
- **Nested selection tests the choosing, not an option.** `honest` picks from the whole grid on four folds and
  scores the fifth. Read its fold picks before citing it for or against a value: the 30 % ladder lost to `default`
  overall because its picks swung between 11, 15 and 30 %, while its three 15 % picks beat `default`.
- **A decision made before the run is stated as one.** List every check with its direction; do not sort them by
  the side they support.

### A run's record travels with its table, and its readers compare it, not only its presence

Every `data/tune/<key>_grades.csv` row carries the run that made it: `rule`, `run_uid`, `walk`, `ref_edge`,
`discharge_load`, `curve_prior_sd`, `grade_withheld`, `null_heldout_curve` (the gate's own number), `evidence_md5`
(the md5s of the three derived tables) and `curve_grad` (the gradient the curve was fitted on, #92); the summary and
`<key>_curve.rds` carry `evidence_md5`, `run_uid` and the gradient, and the score cache its settings (`spec`: fit,
prior, seed, folds, d_floor, extra, evidence, grad). `0320`'s keep-check compares every one of those fields with the
run's own values (`null_heldout_curve` by presence). The readers after it compare what they can hold a field to and
refuse a table that fails: `0325` and `0330` the rule, run, walk, evidence, gradient and flow load (the live table's),
and `0325` the reference edge types across tables; `data-raw/vignette_chinook.R` the rule, walk, evidence and gradient;
`data-raw/vignette_method.R` the gradient, the evidence and one flow load. The gate's fields (`curve_prior_sd`,
`grade_withheld`, `null_heldout_curve`) `0330` and `vignette_chinook.R` check by presence, `0325` all but the prior, and
`vignette_method.R` not at all. `0325` refuses before it writes anything. So a change to the gate, the prior, the walk or the evidence
regrades every key (53 min on the database's host with the walks cold, 2026-10-27; minutes for a key whose walks are cached), which is the cost of never publishing a verdict the code
no longer makes. #73's branch review (five rounds, `planning/archive/2026-10-issue-73-rebuild-evidence-retune-bank/review-round*.md`)
found four axes where a reader had checked presence alone, one of them the gate itself: it compared the curve's
held-out deviance over the visits with a size against no rule's over every modelled visit, so for the width-ruled keys
it favoured publishing, and bull trout spawning's grade rested on it. Compare two deviances only when they are summed
over the same rows (`null_heldout_curve` is no rule scored on the curve's own visits).

The grade tables are ignored and run to gigabytes, so `0320` writes each one's record beside it, `<key>_grades_record.csv` (tracked, #119): the table's constant columns exactly as written, its md5, size and rows, the run, its evidence ledger, the knowledge commit and link's build (version, commit and output-vocabulary tokens, blank before link 0.70.0). `knw_tune_promote()` refuses a promoted key whose record is missing or describes another table, and reads kept keys from their records; the article bundles read and pin the record, and check a table present against it (`KNW_CHECK_GRADES=TRUE` makes `test-vignette-data.R` do the same).

### The segment flows can change under a run; the table comment names the build

`discharge.fwa_v1_segment_monthly` is wet's database load, and wet can reload it between two runs: NewGraphEnvironment/wet#103
reloaded it on 2026-10-19, after #57 tuned and before #65 regraded, and most segment flows moved by up to about ±5 %.
Before comparing two runs that read flows, read the table comment
(`obj_description('discharge.fwa_v1_segment_monthly'::regclass)`, which names the build), and expect a rule-unchanged
check to fail when it differs. `0325` publishes the comment as `discharge_load_at_publish`; recording it at grading
time is #72.
wet writes one comment per table, naming only the scenario loaded last, while the walk and the grade read only
`historical`, so `knw_discharge_load()` refuses a comment that does not name `scenario historical`: after an ssp load
the comment no longer identifies the historical rows, and the walk cache would serve walks made on an older load
(NewGraphEnvironment/wet#88 is the load table that would fix it).

The walk (`inst/sql/ch_dist_profile.sql`) ends at a double-line river's bank, by fresh 0.42.0's rule (#73): a
connector (edge 1400/1450) is never a target, the connector run and the jump's crossing inside the target's polygon
are left out, and every other hop's gap counts. It differs from fresh's `frs_near_river()` in what it is for, not
in the rule: it walks seven river sizes on three flow sources in one pass, uncapped, across watershed-group outlets,
and from any point (a visit's own; the grade starts it at a segment's downstream end). `data-raw/walk_bank_check.R`
is the check against fresh's walk on one group (BULK, 2026-10-22: 0 of 2,460 starts differ by the bank rule; the
`path` class is the two walks' entry conventions, fresh by local code, ours by nearest point). `scripts/sql/` keeps
#54's centreline walk for the frozen `0298`.

The schema can change under a run too: a provincial run in link renames `fresh_default` to `fresh_default_<date>` and
builds a new `fresh_default` in its place (link#361 did so on 2026-10-23 while #73's chain was running, and the comparison
failed on connect). `0320` and `0330` take the schema from `SCHEMA`; every step of one retune names the schema its
evidence was built on, and a chain of runs sets it once.

### Database access

Every script connects with `DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres())`, so libpq reads `PGHOST`,
`PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER` and `PGPASSWORD` (or `~/.pgpass`), and nothing in the code names a
server. Each script's header names the schemas it needs: most need an fwapg load; `0100`, `0110`
and `0160` need a bcfishpass database, and `0200` prefers one (its FISS snapshot was a superset,
and `0200` says when the database has no `bcfishpass` schema). There is no fallback from one
database to another: point the variables at the one the script needs.

R reads `~/.Renviron` at startup and its values **replace** the shell's, so where it sets `PG*`, a
`PGDATABASE=… Rscript …` on the command line is silently ignored (measured 2026-10-16). Set the
database there, or select a `~/.pg_service.conf` entry with `PGSERVICE=<entry>`, which libpq takes
over the `PG*` variables. Set `PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT`, or an unreachable server hangs the script.

**Run the comparison on the database's own host, against its own database.** A query's fixed cost is a round trip:
1.6 ms on the host, 104 to 110 ms from a machine on a remote link (2026-10-24, 2026-10-26). Since #87 grading walks
500 segments per query and keeps every walk in `knw.walk_cache`, so a batched walk costs about 3 ms per walk per
worker on the host and 12 to 18 ms from the remote link, against 116 ms one query per walk; a cold regrade of every key
took 53.4 min on the host, and one key regraded with its walks cached 4.1 min. `0330` regenerates link's flags group by
group on 6 connections, one key at a time (BT rearing 33.4 min, every key 162.9 min with `GPKG=FALSE`; from the remote link #92's took 269 min to compare and 197 more to
write the GeoPackages, which take 14 min on the host, so a run off the host passes `GPKG=FALSE`, #81): it is bound by
the database's cores, so run it on the host. Those minutes are every structure's; since #112 `0330` regenerates
`default` and `door` alone unless `STRUCTURES=all` (the rules it drops took 29 to 33 % of the worker minutes on three
keys), so the research files' `free` and `door_wetland` figures (#92's) are refreshed only on that setting. `0310`, a grading `0320` and every `STAGE` of `0330` check this at
connect with `knw_db_latency_check()`: over a 20 ms round trip they stop with the round trip and what the remote link
cost #92's comparison, unless `REMOTE=TRUE`, and every run logs the round trip and whether `REMOTE` overrode it (#110). A refused run writes its ledger or log under a `_refused` name (`<date>_evidence_build_refused.csv`, and `_tune_refused-<run>` and `_compare_refused-<run>` logs in the run's directory), outside the patterns later steps read (the newest `*_evidence_build_ledger.csv`, the `_tune_run*.txt` that `0335` promotes and `0325` lists), so a run that stopped never becomes the one they read: any new refusal does the same.
`0330` also logs each key's minutes by stage, so a remote run shows which stage the link slows. A second machine helps a database-bound step only with a database of its
own holding the same build (the schema's run and the flow load named in the table comment; the walk travels with the
code). `0320` and `0330` refuse a schema built by another run at connect (`knw_build_record()`), and every grade table's
flow load and walk md5 are compared by its readers; `research/database_builds.md` has the numbers and the load recipe.
Scoring is CPU-bound: the remote machine scored every key in about an hour on 12 workers (2026-10-23).
The host keeps its own ignored `data/` (grade tables, curves, `data/fdis/derived`), which can be an older build than the
promoted run: on 2026-10-28 its visits md5s were 2026-10-25's while the promoted grades named #92's. Before a run there
is held to the tracked tables, compare `data/fdis/derived`'s md5s with the grade table's `evidence_md5`, and stage the
promoted inputs beside the repo where they differ (`data-raw/compare_structures_check.R` takes `TUNE_DIR`,
`COMPARE_DIR` and `EVIDENCE_DIR`). And before timing anything on the database, read `pg_stat_activity`: other sessions
run link builds and comparisons on it, and #112's first timings overlapped one for 20 minutes unnoticed.

**Never chain tuning and comparison until every key's smoke gates have passed (#84).** Score every key, check, then
grade, then compare: `0320` runs its four smoke gates for every key first and stops on a failure, and a chain of runs
must stop at a failed step, so nothing downstream reads a key whose gates failed.

**A full retune and a promotion each start on Al's word, not an agent's judgement.** After a change upstream (a link
build, placement, a flow reload), run `0310` on the new build and `DEV=1 0320`, and report its pick report
(`data/tune/dev/pick_report.csv`: each key's pick beside the published one, whether the published rule is still in the
region, and how far behind the best it now sits). All 22 keys took 7.7 min on 14 workers with no database (#111,
2026-10-28). A full `0320` and `0330 TUNE_DIR=` write ignored candidates and wait for Al's word; so does
`RUN=<run> 0335`, which moves a candidate into the tracked tables, whole or by key, and reruns `0325` (local),
both bundles, the bibliography and the README figure (Al, 2026-10-28: "we will be retuning continuously ... I help
decide when we are retuning"). By key works only onto the kept keys' build: after a new link run or evidence build
every fitted key moves together. A candidate's provenance is by construction: `0320` and `0330` clear a key's files in
the run before a pass rewrites them and write the large ones whole (a GeoPackage, a key's figures, the grade and
comparison tables land only complete), so `0335` trusts what a run holds; never put a file into a candidate by hand
(#111, five review rounds, `planning/archive/2026-10-issue-111-candidate-runs-promotion/`). A promotion that moves the
published numbers also moves pins it cannot revise
(`test-tune_repick.R`'s 1.96 picks, `test-vignette-data.R`'s key count and funnel, the articles' inline checks) and
the `research/` prose that quotes them: those, and the articles' review, follow it by hand.

**Run R from the repo root, and never add a project-level `.Renviron` here.** R loads a
project `.Renviron` *instead of* `~/.Renviron`, not in addition to it, so one silently empties
every `PG*`, `AWS_*` and `GITHUB_PAT`. The symptom accuses the database
(`invalid integer value "NA" for connection option "port"`); the positive control is running the
same command from `~`. `cred.store_source` belongs in `.Rprofile`, which is why it is there.

### Report a result as a plain-language walk, with the specification below it

Lead a modelling result with a plain-language walk (what link does now, what was asked, how it was judged, what was
chosen and why) and a before/after table, then the caveats. For a species, open with its life-history expectation,
then the evidence, then the recommendation, and name what the recommendation is not. Keep the specification below,
not instead.

**Why:** the `research/` files are specifications for whoever did the work; the adopter decides one species at a
time, prior first. Al found `research/habitat_thresholds_tuned.md`'s Method and tie-break "hard to digest"
(2026-10-18), which is what #62, #63 and #64 answer.

**Teach the principle beside each result.** Before a result, one or two sentences in words a reader without the
statistics would follow on the principle it rests on: what the model's scale means (a cloglog step multiplies the
hazard by e), why a term is there (data set and era are sampling differences a rule must not be credited for), what a
prior, penalty or gate is doing; then the numbers. Al (2026-10-23, choosing #73's prior after a plain-language walk
through separation, the scale and the prior): "our write up should teach the principles at the same time as it gives
the results".

**Keep a methods step short.** In a methodology article, explain each step in a few plain sentences, grouping what it
does, why and how where one sentence carries them, and keep counts and settings out of its way; define each term the
reader needs once, in its own place. A fixed what/why/how slot per step buries the reader. Al (2026-10-27, on #93's
article): "burying the reader to meet a format is not the goal. goal is clear methodology and plain language". Read
`writing.md` in full before drafting public prose, not its index.

### A pointer to another issue goes in that issue's body, not a comment

Write a dependency, a "blocked by", a "folded into" or an owed step into the target issue's body, as a task or a
line in its plan, and delete a pointer comment once its content is in the body. Reserve comments for discussion.

**Why:** comments get missed (Al, 2026-10-20). This is stricter than the shared convention ("Issue bodies get edited,
not appended"), which still allows a comment for a cross-repo pointer. A pointer from a public repo names no private
one.

# Agent Operating Rules

How an agent session works here: clocks and waiting, subagents, evidence, and when to come
back to the user. Worked commands and background, under the same headings, are in
soul's `conventions/reference/agent-operations.md`, which no `CLAUDE.md` loads.

Citations sit in `<!-- evidence -->` blocks, which a repo's `CLAUDE.md` omits; the full text
is in `conventions/agent-operations.md`. A new citation goes in its rule's block, and the
remedy stays in the rule (`code-check.md`'s header; `/compact-prep` step 5).

## 1. You Have No Clock Between Tool Calls

**Every duration claim comes from `date`, never from how much waiting felt like
it happened.**

Background `sleep` returns immediately from the agent's side, and the number of
times you have polled is not evidence of elapsed time. Two consecutive tool
calls can be 15 seconds apart by the clock while feeling like ten minutes of
waiting.

**How to apply:** before saying *any* duration — "still running after N
minutes", "this has been X a while", "longer than usual" — run `date -u` and
subtract a real start time. `gh run list --json createdAt` gives it for CI. If a
claim about slowness would change what the user does next, it needs a measured
number or it does not get made.

The same rule covers process state: `ps` and task-status listings have both been observed
wrong. Check the artifact (an output file's size, its mtime, the service's own API), not the
wrapper, and the file, not a link to it (`ls -lL`; §2, "Don't trust status").

**Measure in UTC; report clock times to the user in Vancouver time, and name the zone.**
An ETA or a "finished at" for the user reads `9:22 AM PDT`, not `16:22Z`; add UTC only when the
exact instant matters. Convert with a tool, never by hand (PDT and PST alternate):
`TZ=America/Vancouver date`, or the converter in the reference file for a given instant; keep
an input's trailing `Z`, because a time with no offset is read as machine-local. Durations need
no zone. Stored artifacts stay in UTC: commits, logs, filenames, `research/`, PR and issue bodies.

*14 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### The same blind spot picks the wrong waiting tool

Not having a clock also makes a **chain of background sleeps** feel like
waiting when it is not. Pick the instrument by how many answers you need:

| you need | use |
|---|---|
| one notification when a condition becomes true | `Bash(run_in_background)` with an `until` loop that exits, its probe local or the whole loop on the remote host |
| one per state change, ending on its own | `Monitor` with a command that emits and then exits |
| a value you must have before the next step | a **foreground** call, so the blocking is explicit |
| a long job that notifies when it exits | `Bash(run_in_background)` with the command as plain foreground text: no `&`, no `nohup` |

A repeated `sleep N; grep` is right in none of them. **Tell: if you are about to
spawn a second waiter for the same thing, the first one was the wrong shape.**

**An `until` waiter is only as good as the exit status its probe reads, and `ssh` to
a Mac on the tailnet does not carry one:** it exits 0 whatever the remote command returned.
Put the loop on the remote side and gate on what it prints, or test a probe's output, never
its status (`code-check-shell.md`, "Over Tailscale SSH to a Mac, `ssh` exits 0").

**And a waiter's notification is a wrapper's exit too.** Re-read the condition and the job's
own state in a foreground call before reporting it done, against a marker only this run's end
can produce: clear it at launch, or check it is newer than a stamp touched at launch
(`code-check.md`, "A wrapper's exit is not the work"). A string grepped out of a log is weaker
than either: a traced script writes it when it reads the line, and an `EXIT` trap prints it
on failure.

A `Monitor` filter must also match the failure states, not just the success
one — silence looks identical to "still running", so a watcher that greps only
for the happy path stays quiet through a crash.

**Never end a backgrounded call's command with a trailing `&`.** A trailing `&` (or
`nohup … &`) with nothing in the same command waiting on it, sent with `run_in_background`,
lets the wrapper exit at once, so the notification reports **exit 0** whatever the job
then does. Pick one mechanism from the table, never two.

*20 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Don't edit files a long-running suite is still reading

`devtools::test()` and its equivalents load each test file **when they reach it**,
not at launch, so edits made mid-run are half-applied and the result describes a tree
that never existed. **The tell is a moving denominator:** 3490 passes, then 3496, then
3500, on "the same" tree. `Rscript file.R` parses incrementally too, and there the tell is
a **syntax error quoting a line that does not exist**.

Before a long run, commit. While it runs, do work that touches nothing it reads —
issue bodies, PR text, reading, planning. If an edit cannot wait, kill the run
rather than let it produce a result that has to be re-litigated. And when a long run
fails, get the `file:line` before forming any theory: a mid-flight edit and a real
regression look identical in a summary line.

*9 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

## 2. Subagents Are Evidence, Not Dependencies

**Spawn on your own judgment. Don't block on one. Don't trust its status. Verify its claims in both directions.**

### Spawning is your call, not the user's

Deciding to spawn a subagent is an engineering judgment, the same kind as choosing
to write a test or run a grep. **Do not ask permission for it.** The user is usually not
positioned to answer, and under **Always Away** the work stalls until they wake up, for an
answer that was yours to make.

This does not soften `karpathy.md` §1's asks — *"if uncertain, ask"*. Those are about
**what the user wants**: intent, scope, an ambiguous requirement, a tradeoff only they can
weigh. This is about **how you carry it out**. Ask about intent; decide about mechanism.

#### Standing authorization: the harness bars the Agent tool by default on Opus 5

Opus 5 sessions carry a hardcoded CLI instruction, *"Do not call the AgentTool unless the
user requested it"*, which no local setting reaches. **The clause is conditional, so this
convention is the request:** invoking a skill that mandates subagents (`/code-check`'s
rounds, the Plan review in `planning.md`) **is** the user requesting them. Spawn them. This
is a standing user instruction (the owner, 2026-08-29), for the mandated spawns only: the
bounds below hold, and a workflow or deep-research fan-out still needs an explicit ask.

**Spawn without asking** when a skill or convention mandates it, when you want fresh eyes on
your own work, when a sweep will **locate** what matters faster than reading serially (then
read directly whatever you will act on), or when independent items can run concurrently.
**Do it yourself** when one grep answers it, or when the work depends on conversation context
a subagent will not have. If you would sit idle waiting, spawn and keep working, or do it
inline.

**Bounds you enforce yourself, rather than converting into questions:**

- **Two or three concurrent is the working default, and about five per task.** Bound both.
  Past that total, **say so in your next message.**
- **Do not let a subagent fan out again.** `Explore` and `Plan` cannot spawn;
  `general-purpose` can, so put "do not spawn subagents" in its prompt.
- Unnamed, delivering by file — `planning.md` carries the mechanics.
- **Report after, not before.** Say what you spawned, and relay what it found — a subagent's
  report never reaches the user on its own.

**What is genuinely the user's call is budget, not mechanism.** Two or three reviewers is
not that — it is just doing the work.

*10 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Don't block

Spawn a background subagent, then keep working on the lowest-risk part of the
task — scaffolding, data files, tests. When findings arrive, treat them as a
review of landed work rather than a precondition for starting it. If a result genuinely
must precede the next step, run it synchronously (`run_in_background: false`) so the
blocking is explicit and visible.

*8 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Don't trust status

**Never report an agent as stalled, or as still working, on status alone.** Agent
status and `TaskList` have both been observed to be wrong, and a subagent's
`tasks/<id>.output` is a symlink that `ls -l` reports as frozen; `ls -lL` follows it.
Never read the transcript itself, it overflows the context. Even a growing transcript shows
activity, not that a report will arrive. So decide nothing on it; wait for the event,
against a clock:

- **Note the spawn time with `date -u`** (§1) and wait for the completion notification, not a
  file waiter. Until it arrives, the report is "spawned at T, no notification yet", never
  "stalled". Keep working, outside the diff.
- **Deadline:** 60 minutes from the spawn for a `/code-check` round; none for a background
  Plan review. Check expiry by subtracting the spawn time from `date -u` at each wake; with
  nothing else to do, one backgrounded `sleep <remaining>; echo DEADLINE` is the timer.
- A replacement gets its own findings path, and is a spawn, so it counts toward the bound. The
  original may still deliver: read whichever arrives, both if both do.

**Never record a review as "Clean" on an idle notification.** The reviewer **writes its
findings to a file and reports only the path**; a missing or empty file after the
notification or the deadline means the round is re-run. Spawn reviewers unnamed: a named
spawn idles instead of completing.

### Verify claims, in both directions

Subagent output is evidence, not verdict: acting on a wrong finding and dismissing a late
review wholesale both happen. **Cheap probe first, then act.** Reproduce the claim before
you fix it, and before you dismiss it. A finding you cannot reproduce is a finding you do
not yet understand.

*5 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Fan out inside one process

A workflow that shells out **once per item** costs one permission prompt per item; the same
work **inside one process** costs one prompt total. An unattended run that stops for
approval on item 3 of 200 has gone idle, and the wrapper reports nothing.

- **Prefer one process doing N items over N processes doing one.** Loop inside the
  language runtime; shell out once, for the batch.
- Where a per-item subprocess is genuinely required, allowlist its command **before**
  the run.
- If a run keeps stopping for approval, look at whether the loop sits inside or outside
  the process boundary before adding allowlist entries.

### A subagent that must not know the answer must be a Plan or Explore type

A `general-purpose` subagent carries the project's `CLAUDE.md`, and `Plan` and `Explore` do not, so a
blind reader, a blind reviewer or any control that must not see prior results is spawned as `Plan` or
`Explore`. Check it rather than trusting the brief: a canary of each type, given no tools and asked only
whether its context mentions the term in question, settles it in seconds. Neither type can write, so take
its output from the transcript by script, not by retyping, and audit the transcript's tool calls for reads
outside what it was given.

## 3. Evidence, Not Impressions

**Measure before you characterise. Presence is not provenance. "Unknowable" is a
claim.**

### Measure before you characterise

When a decision turns on **what something contains**, open it and count. Do not
describe it from its structure, from an issue's claim about it, or from a tag list.
A heading tells you a thing is *present*, never that it is *populated*.

**A measurement carries the time it was taken.** One made earlier in the same session is not
a current one, least of all for anything another session can change underneath it. For
anything git-backed, `git fetch` first: reading a local clone and reporting it as the state of the world is the same error
with a longer fuse. **And before hand-rolling a parser for a probe, check whether the code
already has one**: a bespoke parser silently narrows the population it can see.

**A host that times out from one machine is not blocked until the local link is ruled out**:
ping the gateway (`ping -c 30 -i 0.2 <gateway>`) and try a second machine. A lossy link passes
short exchanges and kills long ones, which mimics a selective block.

*15 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### A share is not robust to an unresolved definition until you measure the spread

When a result is expressed as a share, a ratio or a ranking and called "unaffected by
whichever definition proves correct", **compute the statistic under each candidate
definition and report the spread beside it.** If the spread is material against the claim
being made, the definition is a blocker, so schedule it first. A share is invariant to a
filter only when the filter is uncorrelated with the thing being measured.

*20 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Presence is not provenance

When something's **presence** is offered as evidence for **how it got there**, find
the fact that actually discriminates. **Consistency is not support.** Before offering
"X shows Y", ask what else would produce X. If anything would, X is not evidence. When the
user pushes back on an inference, re-derive rather than defend.

*12 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Documents that share an ancestor corroborate nothing

Finding the same claim in three places is not triangulation if one was written from
another. **The tell is agreement with no independent derivation.** Ask of each
restatement: what did its author read? Prose repeats; code does not, so the discriminating
check is almost always to read the thing the prose describes.

- **A search engine's summary is not a source:** fetch the document it names and find the
  sentence, or attribute the claim to the snippet.
- **Derive every number in a release note from the artifact it describes**, not the issue.
- **For "you can tell X by looking at Y", check that Y separates X from not-X.**
- **A carve-out is a number too:** run the check over the population before writing it.
- **Read the code behind a stated quantity or scope before repeating it;** when one instance
  is stale, grep for the sentence, not the file.
- **Treat `every`, `each`, `all N`, `nothing else`, `roughly doubles` and `between X and Y`
  as words to check:** walk the per-member evidence before writing the quantifier. When review
  keeps finding them, list every quantified or inherited claim with a measured verdict
  (`code-check.md`, "A guard's scope, escape hatches, and remedies").

*93 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### "It can only be answered by testing" is a claim with an author

An issue or a colleague saying a question needs a field season, a device or a deploy
is stating a claim, not a property of the problem. Spend the cheap probe first. Then
**bound what the probe closed**: reading a desktop plugin says nothing about the mobile app.
An over-claimed probe is worse than none.

*10 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### A real bug is not necessarily the reported bug

A defect found while investigating a symptom is **evidence, not the answer**. Before
offering it as the cause, check that it produces *exactly* the symptom described,
including the details that sound incidental. Write the reported symptom out and ask whether
the proposed cause produces **all** of it, and say which parts are still unexplained: "this
is a real bug and it may not be your bug" is honest and cheap.

*5 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### An enumeration is not a checklist

A probe listing what exists — subkeys present, columns found, files listed — answers
"what is here", never "what do we want". Before a probe's output becomes work, grep for
each item and ask whether anything consumes it. When it duplicates something already done
another way, name the comparison.

*3 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### A relative descriptor is meaningless without its anchor

"Upstream", "downstream", "above", "below", "before", "after", "parent" — each is
relative to something named **elsewhere in the document**. Resolve the anchor before
drawing any inference from the term; getting it wrong produces a confident and specific
wrong answer. **Where a source describes a sequence — crossings on a stream, releases in a
changelog, stages in a pipeline, commits on a branch — write the order out before
interpreting a single relative term in it.**

*7 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### A safeguard whose mechanism is a human reading a diff is not a control

When a design says "the writes are uncommitted, so the diff is the review", check
whether anyone reads diffs. Here nobody does, so gate on **blast radius** instead: a write
that reaches one repo just happens; a write that reaches every repo (a soul convention) may
be appended to within its budget but edited or removed only through an issue. Where a real check is
needed, make it mechanical — a grep for a contradicting rule, an assertion that nothing
above the `CLAUDE.md` marker moved, a guard that resolves every heading against a base SHA.
The user still wants a short, honest account of what was written: a report, not a review.

*3 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Not finding it is not evidence it does not exist

Before building a fetcher, harvester, backup or sourcing routine, **search the sibling
packages for the verb** — enumerate the org's installed packages and grep their exports
(the command is in the reference file), and list the directory it names where
operational drivers live outside any package. **Then read the README ownership table and the
above-marker `CLAUDE.md` of any package plausibly adjacent — exports understate remit.**

**Tell:** you are about to write something whose name is a verb the ecosystem already does
somewhere. Fetch, sync, harvest, backup, source, register, publish. **A function existing
in two places is worse than it existing in neither**, and **check what the *architecture*
says, not just what exists**: an issue that already assigned the boundary settles it.

*26 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

#### The storage version: one store is not the world

A negative result is only ever as wide as the store you looked in. **`aws s3` and `s3cmd`
address different clouds and are invisible to each other**, so enumerate the stores before
searching them, and prefer the job that stages data to whatever a bucket happens to hold.
The same holds for **checkouts**: a local `grep` across the local checkouts answers a question
about this disk. Use `gh api -X GET search/code -f q="org:NewGraphEnvironment <term>"`,
which indexes **default branches only**: a file on a feature branch needs
`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path>?ref=<branch>`. Its index is not complete even
there, so confirm a negative that matters by cloning and grepping the repos it covers. Each
S3 tool lists only its own provider's buckets; the backup script names the rest.

*17 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

#### The temporal version: what you build against may be about to change

**Before a design depends on a peer repo's artifact** (a guard comparing against its files,
an extractor reading its output, automation keyed to its layout), **search the peer repo's
open issues and PRs for work that changes it**, and read the body of each adjacent hit, not
only its title. Unquoted words match anywhere; a quoted phrase must match exactly and misses
rewordings. A full 100 rows means the list was cut: narrow the words.

```bash
gh search issues --include-prs --repo NewGraphEnvironment/<peer> --state open --limit 100 <artifact words>
```

## 4. Decisions Up Front, Then Run

**Ask at the plan gate. After approval, run to the PR. Before a plan exists, a question wants an answer.**

The first three subsections are one rule on one axis — *when* to come back to the
user — and they are only correct as a set. The rest decide what the user is handed when
you do come back.

### After plan approval, run every phase to the PR

Plan approval is the authorization for every mechanical step after it. Run every
phase, commit atomically per phase, archive the PWF, push, open the PR, and report
**once**, at the end. Do not stop between phases to report progress. **The merge is a
separate instruction** — *to the PR* ends at the open PR, and `/gh-pr-merge` runs when the
user invokes it or the instruction says so.

- **Inside it:** correcting the plan when a review disproves it (reported in the summary),
  unless the correction is itself a fork of the kind below; filing issues, opening PRs and
  editing bodies in NGE repos; pushing the feature branch. Blockers that cannot be resolved
  are filed as issues and named in the final report rather than held open.
- **Not inside it:** posting outside our repos (below), and anything a convention names as
  its own gate — the merge, a change to the machine (`newgraph.md`), a push into an artifact
  a human is testing on (`code-check.md`).

*8 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Before a plan exists, a question wants an answer

The same terseness that means "go" after approval means "answer me" before it. A
turn that ends in a question mark, with no approved plan, gets an answer and a
one-line offer of the work — not the first commit toward it. When the ask is to understand
something, keep it short and concrete; a worked example beats a taxonomy. **The mandate
starts at plan approval.**

*4 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### What still interrupts, and where it goes

A decision that permanently shapes stored data — a key, an identifier, a schema
choice, a deprecation shim versus a hard rename — is the user's, and it goes to the
**plan gate**, batched, as two or three concrete options with the recommended one
first and the consequence stated. Found mid-run, it is still not the agent's to decide:
ask it the same way — options, recommendation first, phone-answerable — commit, and
continue on the phases that do not depend on it while the answer is outstanding
(`planning.md`, "When Something Keeps Failing" — escalating is not stopping).

In plan mode, collect the "this changes what I build" forks and ask them together before
`ExitPlanMode`. Mechanism is never a question (§2), nor is anything with a conventional
default: pick it, say so, move on.

*4 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Never post outside our own repos without approval

Never post to a venue outside NGE's own repositories without the user's explicit
approval for that specific post — upstream GitHub issues and PR comments, mailing
lists, forums, third-party trackers. **Drafting is welcome and expected**: write the
comment, show it, wait. The sending needs the word: an upstream comment is published under
our name, indexed at once, and cannot be unpublished.

- Our own repos are unaffected; filing and editing issues there needs no asking.
- **Reading upstream is unrestricted and worth doing.**
- Offer the draft in the reply, and say plainly that nothing has been posted.

*4 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Upstream, we are guests: fork first, offer an issue, disclose AI

We build on other people's work: gratitude and humility in every step that touches it.
Maintainers may read anything we write about their code, so describe what we saw rather than
diagnose their design, offer rather than propose, and leave them every road to lead.

- **Fix on our fork the same day,** one concern per branch from upstream's default branch,
  no planning files and no `#N` in its commits, the draft in a fork issue labelled
  `upstream-draft`. Pin our packages to the fork's integration branch until upstream holds
  every fix on it, their way.
- **Upstream gets a short issue that offers:** thanks, a reprex, the options as we see them,
  and a pull request if it helps. Send one when asked, or first only where outside pull
  requests are routinely merged. One open item per maintainer, timed around their load.
- **About 200 words, no SRED line.** A design change goes in as a question.
- **Say plainly that Claude Code helped,** in a sentence from the `upstream-draft` on, and offer
  an `Assisted-by` reword in the pull request. Where AI-assisted contributions are unwelcome,
  send no code.
- **Never ping by accident:** in our repos' issues and pull requests an upstream item is
  backticked, never a URL, link or bare `#N` (a fork's reached upstream's once), unless the user
  wants the ping; commit messages name none, even backticked. An edit cannot take a ping
  back. In a fork checkout `gh` targets upstream, so pass `--repo` for our fork.
- **Homework before, notes after:** who contributes, stated policy, AI use, current load,
  response pace, kept in soul's `research/upstream-projects.md`, revised after every reply,
  merge or silence.
- Raise upstream only what would help their other users. If a maintainer would rather not
  hear from us, keep the fork or move on.

*32 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Credit Claude, link no session

Nothing we write carries a session link. In our repos, commits end with `Co-Authored-By`, PR
bodies with "Generated with Claude Code", and issues with no Claude line bar an
`upstream-draft`'s sentence.

### Auto mode refuses a production write whatever the chat says

Auto mode's classifier can refuse a command as a production write: a live store rewritten,
a deploy, a publish. When it does, approval given in chat does not reach it, and in the
recorded case a restart did not clear it either. On the **first** such refusal, say so once and offer two routes:
the user leaves auto mode for that step (Shift+Tab) and approves the prompt, or runs the
bare command themselves (below). Do not retry, and do not suggest a restart.

It is not the secret-read clamp (`newgraph.md`, "Reading a secret clamps the rest of the
session"), which names *earlier conversation content* and needs a restart. This refusal
names a **category** of action, such as "Production Deploy" — and the category need not
describe a deploy: a plain `git push` of local commits has been refused as "Excess
Sensitive Detail". In a cloud session "External System Writes" covers a `gh api -X POST`
issue comment; the `mcp__github__*` write tool makes the same write unprompted.

**It classifies the command text, so it also fires on a write the file tools can make
safely.** Where what was refused is an edit to a tracked file rather than the publish
itself, take that route first — Read and Edit, which the denial text offers as a safer
method — and say the classification was wrong. Keep the two routes above for the command
that really does publish.

*23 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Hand the user bare commands

When the user must run a command themselves — an interactive login, a
sudo-needs-TTY operation, anything the Bash tool is blocked from running — give the
**bare command**, in a fenced block, ready to paste. Never prefix it with `!`: here it does
not run, or runs from `$HOME`.

- **Anchor every path**: absolute, or after `cd <repo-root> &&` on the same line.
- Keep it paste-safe (`grep`/`awk` over a nested `python3 -c` in remote quotes), **short
  enough not to wrap**, and say what the first output line must read (`PUBLISH run`), so a
  dropped flag shows before anything is written.
- **Several commands go on one line.** A multi-line paste can run only its first line, with no
  error: join them with `&&` or a `for` loop over the list, still short enough not to wrap;
  past that, hand one per turn.

**A file under `~/Downloads` may be unreadable by the agent process** (macOS folder
protection, per app and per machine). Probe with
`ls ~/Downloads >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo readable || echo blocked`; Desktop and Documents are
granted separately, so probe each. If blocked, ask for one copy into the repo, with absolute
paths. Full Disk Access for the terminal app removes the block.

*13 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Read a name for what it sounds like: the user dictates

Messages often arrive by voice, so names come spelled by sound ("maxxam creek" was Maxan
Creek). Resolve a place name against BC Geographic Names or the Freshwater Atlas before it
lands in an issue, code or a query, and read an odd phrase for the word it sounds like
before asking about it.

### Link every issue and PR you name to the user

When a message to the user names an issue or a PR, make the number a link the user can
click: `[repo#12](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/12)`,
`[repo PR #13](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/13)`.

- **Say what each one is** in a few words, unless its sentence already does: a list of bare
  links fails this. A `Stop` hook, `settings/hooks/reply_links-check.py`, holds a reply that
  breaks either half; its no-context check is a heuristic, so a reply it misjudges may stand.
- Issues under `/issues/N`, pull requests under `/pull/N`; when unsure, ask `gh` for the URL.
- **Cross-repo references carry the repo** (`other#12`): a bare `#N` is a working link to the
  wrong repo, and naming the collision in prose afterwards does not fix it; re-qualify the link.
- Before sending a report with many numbers, spot-check two or three through `gh`: the ones
  typed from memory or whose type you inferred.
- Scope is messages to the user, and PR and issue bodies read from outside the repo; commit
  messages autolink already. An upstream item in our repos' GitHub text is backticked (§4, pings).

*11 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/agent-operations.md`.*

### Surface upstream defects; do not work around them

When a dependency or an external API misbehaves, surface it and ask rather than
coding around it: a workaround hides the defect from whoever could fix it, and most of the
dependencies in question are **first-party**, so a local patch leaves the bug in place for
every other consumer. Same instinct as `newgraph.md`'s "install missing packages, don't
workaround", applied to a *broken* dependency.

**How to apply:** reproduce it minimally, file an issue in the owning repo with the
repro and the exact lines (a third party's: a fork issue first, above), report it, and carry on if it is not blocking. The rule is
*do not hide it*, not *do not continue*.

# Cartography

## Style Registry

Use the `gq` package for all shared layer symbology. Never hardcode hex color values when a registry style exists.

```r
library(gq)
reg <- gq_reg_main()  # load once per script — 51+ layers
```

**Core pattern:** `reg$layers$lake`, `reg$layers$road`, `reg$layers$bec_zone`, etc.

### Translators

| Target | Simple layer | Classified layer |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| tmap | `gq_tmap_style(layer)` → `do.call(tm_polygons, ...)` | `gq_tmap_classes(layer)` → field, values, labels |
| mapgl | `gq_mapgl_style(layer)` → paint properties | `gq_mapgl_classes(layer)` → match expression |

### Custom styles

For project-specific layers not in the main registry, use a hand-curated CSV and merge:

```r
reg <- gq_reg_merge(gq_reg_main(), gq_reg_custom("path/to/custom.csv"))
```

Install: `pak::pak("NewGraphEnvironment/gq")`

## Map Targets

| Output | Tool | When |
|--------|------|------|
| PDF / print figures | `tmap` v4 | Bookdown PDF, static reports |
| Interactive HTML | `mapgl` (MapLibre GL) | Bookdown gitbook, memos, web pages |
| QGIS project | Native QML | Field work, Mergin Maps |

## Key Rules

- **`sf_use_s2(FALSE)`** at top of every mapping script
- **Compute area BEFORE simplify** in SQL
- **No map title** — title belongs in the report caption
- **Legend over least-important terrain** — swap legend and logo sides when it reduces AOI occlusion. No fixed convention for which side.
- **Four-corner rule** — legend, logo, scale bar, keymap each get their own corner. Never stack two in the same quadrant.
- **Bbox must match canvas aspect ratio** — compute the ratio from geographic extents and page dimensions. Mismatch causes white space bands.
- **Consistent element-to-frame spacing** — all inset elements should have visually equal margins from the frame edge
- **Map fills to frame** — basemap extends edge-to-edge, no dead bands. Use near-zero `inner.margins` and `outer.margins`.
- **Suppress auto-legends** — build manual ones from registry values
- **ALL CAPS labels appear larger** — use title case for legend labels (gq `gq_tmap_classes()` handles this automatically via `to_title()` fallback)
- **Google imagery is a link, never an embed beside our map** — Google Maps Platform terms §3.2.3(e) bar using its services "with or near a non-Google Map", so no Google panel beside an Esri or Sentinel one, key or not. Link per feature instead (template in the `cartography` skill), as an undated look: Google Maps does not date its imagery
- **A maptiles custom provider URL ends in `.jpg`** — in maptiles 0.11.0, `create_provider()` with an extensionless tile URL fails at `get_tiles()` with `cannot coerce type 'closure' to vector of type 'character'`; `.../MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}.jpg`, the form its built-in Esri providers use, works and Esri serves the same tiles
- **Ask Wayback, not the map, for newer Esri imagery** — call `dft_wayback_captures(zoom = z)` once per zoom, 10 to 22, and compare: one call keeps one zoom per feature
- **Give a web map hex colours, never R colour names** — `grey80` draws in tmap and ggplot2, but MapLibre (mapgl) cannot parse it and drops the whole layer: the console's first error is `Could not parse color from value 'grey80'`, then `Cannot style non-existing layer` when a control touches it. Convert with `m <- grDevices::col2rgb(x, alpha = TRUE); grDevices::rgb(t(m[1:3, ]), alpha = m[4, ], maxColorValue = 255)` or hard-code hex, and check for `NA` before converting: it comes back `#FFFFFF00`, a layer drawn transparent rather than an error

## Self-Review (after every render)

Read the PNG and check before showing anyone.

### Placement

1. Correct polygon/study area shown? (verify source data, not just the bbox)
2. Map fills the page? (no white/black bands)
3. Keymap inside frame with spacing from edge?
4. No element overlap? (each in its own corner)
5. Legend over least-important terrain?
6. Consistent spacing across all elements?
7. Scale bar breaks appropriate for extent?

### Does it communicate?

Every check above is about **where elements sit**. A map can satisfy all seven
and still fail to say what it is about — so these are not optional extras, they
are the half of the review that the placement list structurally cannot reach.

8. **Is every prominent feature in the legend?** Work the other direction from
   the usual one: rank what draws the eye *in the rendered image*, then confirm
   each of the top few appears in the legend. Building the legend from the layer
   list instead answers "did I list my layers", which is a different question and
   always says yes.
9. **Is the subject obvious to someone who has never seen this area?** An AOI
   that renders identically to its surroundings is not delineated by a thin
   boundary line — the reader has to be told where to look. Containment (a fill,
   a dimmed exterior, a mask) is what does it.
10. **Does the symbology have a hierarchy, or is it flat?** If one class holds
    the great majority of the features, it will dominate regardless of how
    correct its size is. Ask what the map is *for* and de-emphasise or filter
    accordingly — and say in the caption or prose that you did.
11. **Does the basemap earn its contrast cost?** A basemap that adds no readable
    terrain is not neutral: it lowers the contrast of everything drawn over it.
    Blend parameters that mute it into a flat field are worse than no basemap.
12. **Is the type sized for the width it is published at, not rendered at?** A
    7 in figure squeezed into a ~700 px column loses roughly 40% — text set at
    `size = 0.5` for the render lands at a few pixels on the page. Check the
    figure at its delivered width.

### Why this half exists

Placement checks can all pass on a map nobody can read; these ask whether it communicates.

## Land Cover Change

Use [drift](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/drift) and [flooded](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/flooded) together for riparian land cover change analysis. flooded delineates floodplain extents from DEMs and stream networks; drift tracks what's changing inside them over time.

**Pipeline:**

```r
# 1. Delineate floodplain AOI (flooded)
valleys <- flooded::fl_valley_confine(dem, streams, area_field = "upstream_area_ha")

# 2. Fetch, classify, summarize (drift)
rasters   <- drift::dft_stac_fetch(aoi, source = "io-lulc", years = c(2017, 2020, 2023))
classified <- drift::dft_rast_classify(rasters, source = "io-lulc")
summary    <- drift::dft_rast_summarize(classified, unit = "ha")

# 3. Interactive map with layer toggle
drift::dft_map_interactive(classified, aoi = aoi)
```

- Class colors come from drift's shipped class tables (IO LULC, ESA WorldCover)
- For production COGs on S3, `dft_map_interactive()` serves tiles via titiler — set `options(drift.titiler_url = "...")`
- See the [drift vignette](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/drift/articles/land-cover-change.html) for a worked example (Neexdzii Kwa floodplain, 2017-2023)


# CI Monitoring

When this repo has GitHub Actions workflows, scan recent runs on session start, so a failed deploy, vignette build or citation update does not linger until someone notices.

## On Session Start

```bash
gh run list --limit 5 --json status,conclusion,name,createdAt,databaseId \
  --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion == "failure" or .conclusion == "cancelled")'
```

Keep a `cancelled` row only if its annotations report a timeout ("A timed-out run reads `cancelled`"); say timed out, not failed.

If any failures since the last visit, surface to the user before starting other work:

> Workflow `<name>` failed `<time>` ago (run `<id>`). Investigate with `gh run view <id> --log-failed`. Fix or proceed with current task?

User decides; do not auto-fix. `/gh-pr-merge` watches a fresh merge's runs; this scan is the backstop for failures nobody watched (web-UI merges, schedules, dispatches).

## A green run does not mean the site is current

CI conclusion and published content are two different facts. Check the second one
directly when it matters — the deploy commit, not the run status:

```bash
git fetch -q origin gh-pages && git log -1 --format='%s' FETCH_HEAD
# "Deploying to gh-pages from @ owner/repo@<sha> 🚀"  <- the last commit that started a run?
```

Compare it with the last commit that started a run, not with the tip: a bot commit and a
housekeeping push tagged `[skip ci]` start none, so a site built from the commit below them
is current when they touch nothing the site publishes.

GitHub can create a workflow run minutes after the push that triggered it, and
out of order with a later push, so a parent commit's run can deploy over its child's with
both runs green and the published site one commit stale.

Things that do **not** fix this, so don't reach for them:

- `cancel-in-progress: true` — cancels an *overlapping* run. In the measured case the
  runs never overlapped (`created == started` on both, second created after first
  finished), so there was nothing to cancel.
- A `concurrency:` group — the r-lib pkgdown template already sets one at the job
  level (`group: pkgdown-${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.run_id }}`).
  Grepping for a top-level `concurrency:` key misses it and invites a redundant
  "fix". Serializing runs doesn't order events that arrive late.

There is no workflow-side fix, because the reordering happens before the workflow
exists. The remedy is detection: check the deploy provenance, and re-dispatch
(`gh workflow run <file> --ref main`) if it's behind. Harmless when the stale
commit changed nothing the site publishes — confirm via `.Rbuildignore` / `_pkgdown.yml`
rather than assuming.

## Don't push to the default branch between a merge and its CI settling

The r-lib templates set `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress: true`, so a second push
to `main` cancels the first push's still-running workflows. That is correct behaviour and
it is not the problem; the problem is that a **cancelled** run and a **failed** run look
the same in the status column, so a routine follow-up push turns a green merge into
something the next person has to go read a log about — and the log does not exist.

The routine follow-up is the one that bites, because it is the one nobody counts as a
push: a typo fix, a `.gitignore` line, an untagged `CLAUDE.md` drift sync. `/compact-prep`
step 6 runs `claude_md_drift.sh apply`, which **pushes**, and after `/gh-pr-merge` that
lands seconds after the merge. A housekeeping push carries `[skip ci]`, starts no run and
cancels nothing only where soul's `ci_skip.sh` admits it: every commit touches only
`CLAUDE.md`, `comms/`, `planning/`, `research/` or `.claude/`, in an R package whose shape
it admits. Anywhere else the sync pushes untagged, and this rule holds.

Order them: watch the merge's runs to completion, *then* push anything else.

Where a push has already gone out and cancelled something, `/gh-pr-merge` step 10 has the
reading: `cancelled`/`skipped` is `⊘ superseded` unless its annotation reports a timeout, and the thing to confirm
is that the newest SHA that started a run passed. Do not re-dispatch the cancelled one.

## Don't use `gh run watch` to wait

It polls hard enough to trip GitHub's *secondary* rate limit, which `gh api
/rate_limit` does not report — every primary bucket reads full while calls return
403. Retrying extends it. Poll sparsely with `gh run view <id> --json status,conclusion`,
and prefer `git fetch` over the REST API for anything git can answer.

## A setup failure and a build failure look identical in the status column

`gh pr checks` and the Actions UI report one word per job. A run that died fetching its
own toolchain and a run that died because the code is broken both read `fail`, and only
the second says anything about what you just shipped.

```
Error in download.file(...) : status was 'SSL connect error'
download of package 'pak' failed
Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called 'pak'
```

That is `setup-r-dependencies` failing before the package was ever built. On a release
commit the natural but wrong reading is "the release is broken".

**Read which step failed before drawing a conclusion**, especially on a release commit
where the instinct is to distrust the tag:

```bash
gh run view <id> --log-failed | grep -iE 'error|fatal' | head
```

If it died in dependency setup, rerun once. If it dies the same way again it is the
upstream CDN, and the honest move is to say so and stop — not to keep spending runs on
something no change in the repo can fix.

A job that failed with **no steps** never started, and `--log-failed` answers `log not found`.
Read why from its check run's annotations, `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/check-runs/<job id>/annotations
--jq '.[].message'`: a refusal for failed payments or a spending limit is the account owner's to fix, and a
re-run before they fix it is refused the same way.

*6 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/ci-monitoring.md`.*

## A timed-out run reads `cancelled`
Read a `cancelled` run's annotations before calling it superseded: its job ids from `gh run view <id> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[].databaseId'`, then `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/check-runs/<job id>/annotations`. A timeout says "The job has exceeded the maximum execution time", and its `--log-failed` is empty.

## R workflows live in NewGraphEnvironment/flows
Change a runner, timeout or step there and fast-forward `v1`; a workflow marked at its top as its own is changed in its repo. Re-run all jobs: re-run failed reuses the old copy.

## A hung setup step holds the concurrency group for six hours
A run `in_progress` long past its usual duration, with a newer run of it `pending` behind, is a hang: confirm no step moved (`gh run view <id> --json jobs`), then `gh run cancel <id>`; the lasting fix is `timeout-minutes:`. A slow `setup-r-dependencies` may be compiling (`ℹ Building <pkg>`, in the web UI while it runs); sources on `cran.rstudio.com` mean `code-check-r.md`, "pak Behavior".

*9 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/ci-monitoring.md`.*

## A job-level `concurrency` group must vary with the matrix, or the jobs cancel each other

`concurrency` at the **job** level is evaluated **per matrix job**, so a group string that
does not vary with the matrix puts every runner in one group — and with
`cancel-in-progress: true` they cancel each other. At most one platform runs per push,
which is the entire justification for having a matrix.

```yaml
# WRONG: identical for all three entries
concurrency:
  group: check-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# right
  group: check-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}-${{ matrix.config.os }}
```

`fail-fast: false` does not help — that governs failures, not cancellation.

**It fails in the quiet direction.** A cancelled run reports `cancelled`, not `failure`,
which `/gh-pr-merge` step 10 correctly reads as `⊘ superseded` — so two platforms that
never ran look like two platforms that were superseded by a newer push. Nothing is red and
nothing says the coverage was lost.

The entries above concern cancellation **between pushes**, which is the behaviour you
want. This is cancellation **within one push**, which is never what you want.

## A push `paths:` filter skips an empty commit, and dispatch and schedule run only from the default branch
Before planning to re-run a workflow on a feature branch, check how it is triggered. An empty commit (`git commit --allow-empty`) changes no files, so a `push` trigger with a `paths:` filter skips it, and the skip is silent: no run is created, so nothing reports anything. `workflow_dispatch` only works for a workflow file already on the default branch, and `schedule` only fires from there. So a branch-only workflow is re-run in one of three ways: push trigger with no `paths:` (the branch filter scopes it), `gh run rerun <id>`, or a commit that touches a filtered path.

*1 line of evidence for this rule is in `conventions/ci-monitoring.md`.*

## A commit pushed by the Actions token starts no workflow, so wait on the SHA you pushed
Key a CI waiter on the SHA you pushed, never on the default branch's tip: a bot commit made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` (an `update-citation-cff` auto-commit, a docs regen) lands on top of yours and, by GitHub's design, triggers no workflow run, so a loop waiting for runs on the tip waits forever.

The tip moves seconds after a release push, which is exactly when a waiter is started. The bot commit also needs no check of its own when it only touches a file the site does not publish; confirm the deploy provenance instead (the `gh-pages` subject names the SHA that was built).

*1 line of evidence for this rule is in `conventions/ci-monitoring.md`.*

## A pending run cancelled by a `concurrency` group runs no steps, so its failure alarm never fires
With `cancel-in-progress: false`, GitHub keeps one running and one pending run per group, and a newer run cancels the pending one before its job starts. An `if: failure() || cancelled()` alarm step is part of that job, so it never runs and the displaced run disappears silently. Count on the next scheduled run to pick the work up, or dispatch it by hand. Do not write that the alarm covers it.

*1 line of evidence for this rule is in `conventions/ci-monitoring.md`.*

## A deploy commit on `gh-pages` is not yet a served page
Before telling anyone a Pages URL is live, fetch it and compare the bytes with the source: the deploy commit lands on `gh-pages` before the `pages-build-deployment` run publishes it, and until that run finishes the URL still answers 404.

*1 line of evidence for this rule is in `conventions/ci-monitoring.md`.*

## `gh run list --commit` needs the full SHA, and `--workflow` cannot name the Pages run
Key a CI waiter on `gh run list --commit "$(git rev-parse <ref>)"` and pick a run by name in `--jq`: a short SHA returns an empty list with exit 0, and `--workflow 'pages build and deployment'` fails, because GitHub's built-in Pages run has no workflow file.

Both fail quietly in a waiter: an empty list reads as "no runs yet", so the loop runs to its cap, and a failed `--workflow` lookup leaves the run id empty.

# Code Check — Python
Traps in Python: the interpreter, pytest, the HTTP stack under pystac, and MkDocs.

*Index only: each rule's heading and first sentence. The full text is soul's `conventions/code-check-python.md`; read it before writing or reviewing code in its area. `/code-check` loads it in full.*

### A script named after a stdlib module shadows that module when run by path
Name a script so it cannot collide with the standard library (`enum_sites.py`, not `enum.py`): run by path, its directory is first on `sys.path`, so every `import enum` in the process, `re`'s included, gets the script.

### Proxy variables do not take a pystac test offline: block at the socket
To make Python tests network-proof, patch the socket layer to refuse every non-loopback lookup and connection, in `pytest_configure`, and clear the proxy variables with `NO_PROXY=*`.

### A conftest guard covers only the invocations that load it
Put a session-wide guard in the repository's root `conftest.py`, and pin it by behaviour in a child process: pytest loads a conftest only for the paths it is given and their parents, so a guard in `tests/conftest.py` is absent from `pytest src/...`.

### `mkdocs build --strict -q` passes a dead link
Run `mkdocs build --strict` without `-q`, and set all seven `validation:` keys to `warn` in `mkdocs.yml`: `-q` raises the log level past WARNING, strict counts only the warnings it sees, and so it counts nothing.

### `tempfile.mkstemp` then `os.replace` leaves the target at mode 0600
Set the temp file's mode before the rename: the target's own (`os.stat(path).st_mode & 0o7777`) when it exists, `0o666 & ~umask` when it does not.

### A line break inside an f-string's braces parses only on Python 3.12+
Parse or test a script under its declared `requires-python` floor (`uv run --python 3.11 --script …`): PEP 701 (3.12) allows a newline inside an f-string's braces, so code that passes on 3.12 can be a SyntaxError on 3.11.

# Code Check — R
Traps in R: the language and base/utils behaviour, package internals (`R CMD build`, `.Rbuildignore`, roxygen, lintr, `data-raw/`, testthat, pak), and the DBI/duckdb/arrow data layer.

*Index only: each rule's heading and first sentence. The full text is soul's `conventions/code-check-r.md`; read it before writing or reviewing code in its area. `/code-check` loads it in full.*

### Read-back shape must match write-back shape
A script that reads a file, transforms it, and writes it **back to the same path** is idempotent only if the reader accepts the shape the writer produces.

### Moving prose into a code chunk hides it from tools that scan the document
- Tools that scan an R Markdown document for prose — citation detection, cross-references, spell-check, word counts — skip code chunks.

### `fs::dir_ls(glob = )` matches the FULL path, so a bare filename pattern matches nothing
- `fs::dir_ls(dir, glob = "form_*.gpkg")` returns **zero** for a directory full of `form_*.gpkg` files.

### `glue()` trims common leading whitespace
- `glue::glue()` strips the common indentation of its input, so a template whose output must preserve exact indentation (XML, YAML, Makefiles, Python) comes out subtly wrong — valid-looking, wrongly indented.

### A `glue()` named argument shadows caller variables in the arguments after it
Compute each value before the call and pass the result.

### `f(g(x)) <- v` needs a `g<-`, not an evaluated `g(x)`
- R parses **any** call on the left of `<-` as a replacement function, all the way down.

### A replacement function on an `xml_missing` node is a silent no-op
`xml2::xml_find_first()` returns an `xml_missing` object when nothing matches — not `NULL`, not an error.

### `download.file(quiet = TRUE)` never tells you the HTTP status — read it from `curl`
Read an HTTP status from `curl::curl_fetch_disk()`'s `status_code`, never from `download.file()` messages.

### A URL handed to a reader goes through R's 60 s connection timeout
Download a large remote file to a `tempfile()` with httr2 or curl and read the copy, never `jsonlite::fromJSON(url)`, `readRDS(url(u))` or `read.csv(u)`.

### `on.exit()` at a script's top level never fires
- `on.exit()` registers a handler on the *current frame*.

### A `data-raw/` script must load the source tree, not the installed package
- `requireNamespace("pkg")` succeeds whenever **any** version is installed, so a guard shaped like `if (!requireNamespace("pkg")) pkgload::load_all()` silently runs against the installed one.

### `lintr` also resolves against the installed package, not the source tree
A lint warning of `no visible binding` for a constant added on this branch is usually the installed package being stale; check `exists(name, asNamespace(pkg))` and reinstall before changing any code.

### Regenerated binaries churn git even when nothing changed
- Formats that embed a creation timestamp or other run-varying metadata produce a different file on every rebuild.

### Tests that silently do not run
`expect_snapshot()` **skips on CRAN**, and `testthat` treats a non-interactive run as CRAN by default.

### testthat counts an uncaught error under `error`, not `failed`
Count `r$failed > 0 | r$error` over `r <- as.data.frame(testthat::test_file(f))`, never `failed` alone.

### A `skip_if_not()` skips only its own `test_that()` block
Before blaming a failure, or its absence, on a skip, find the `test_that()` block the skip sits in.

### `expect_gt()` and friends take no `info` argument
`expect_true()`, `expect_false()` and `expect_equal()` accept `info =`; the comparison expectations — `expect_gt`, `expect_lt`, `expect_gte`, `expect_lte` — do not, and passing one is an **error**, not a warning:

### pak Behavior
- pak stops on first unresolvable package — all subsequent packages are skipped

### Reproducibility
- Branch pins (`pkg@branch`) are not reproducible — document why used; the fuller pin policy (no suffix by default, never a bare SHA) is under "Two repos pinning the same remote" below

### A duplicate knitr chunk label fails the build, and reading the diff will not find it
Chunk labels must be unique **within a document**.

### `R CMD build` ships every top-level directory not in `.Rbuildignore`
- Internal coordination directories — `comms/`, `research/`, `planning/`, `dev/` — land in the tarball and therefore in the library of anyone installing from GitHub.

### `R CMD build` ships the `.git` FILE when you build from a worktree
A package built from a `git worktree` ships `.git` (a file holding the developer's absolute path), because R excludes only a `.git` directory; list `^\.git$` in `.Rbuildignore`.

### `.Rbuildignore` has no comment syntax — every line is a live regex
`tools:::inRbuildignore` loops over every non-empty line and ORs `grepl()` of it against the file list.

### Base name shadowing in formal args
- Avoid `names`, `length`, `data`, `c`, `t`, `T`, `F`, etc. as formal argument names.

### Cross-function consistency for label/string normalization
- When two functions in the same package both decide whether a string is a "system value" (or any normalized form), they MUST use the same comparison.

### `$` on a list partial-matches, so a longer sibling key answers for a missing one
- `x$foo` on a list returns `x$foo_bar` when `foo` is absent and `foo_bar` is the only key with that prefix.

### A database driver's value is not a base R type — and it fails twice
A column fetched through DBI does not arrive as the base type its SQL type suggests.

### A value compared as `::text` in SQL has PostgreSQL's spelling, not R's
Write native types from R and cast once in SQL.

### arrow dplyr backend: no grouped slice — bridge to duckdb
- arrow's dplyr backend errors on grouped `slice_max`/`slice_min` (`arrow_not_supported("Slicing grouped data")`).

### as.POSIXct on a Date pins UTC midnight; on a character it uses the machine zone
Construct instants explicitly: a `Date` always becomes UTC midnight whatever `tz =` says, and a character with no zone is read in the machine's zone, so pass `tz =` at parse time.

### as.POSIXct on character infers ONE format for the whole vector
- `as.POSIXct(x)` on a character vector picks a single format by finding the first candidate that parses **every** element — and `strptime` **ignores trailing characters**.

### Inserting a helper between a roxygen block and its function rebinds `@export`
- roxygen2 attaches a block to **whatever object follows it**.

### open_dataset(unify_schemas = TRUE) requires aligned types
- Cross-prefix/file schema unification only merges what types allow: `timestamp[us, tz=UTC]` will not merge with naked `timestamp[us]`, `Grade: string` not with `Grade: double`.

### duckdb larger-than-memory dedup: shard the work — settings won't save you
- duckdb's **window operator** (QUALIFY row_number ...) does not spill enough to survive big partitions (OOM'd an 8 GB limit on a ~124M-row input).

### `nzchar(NA)` is TRUE — non-empty checks silently pass NA
- `nzchar(NA)` returns `TRUE`, so the natural "is this cell filled in" test — `all(nzchar(trimws(x)))` — waves through a column full of `NA`.

### A `for` loop that builds `aes()` captures the loop variable lazily
`aes()` quotes its arguments, so `aes(fill = lab[i])` is not evaluated until the plot is drawn — by which time `i` holds its **last** value.

### ggplot2 legends and labels: a key for an unused factor level, and ggrepel labels that must avoid each other
Keep `drop = FALSE` on the scale and give the layer a named `show.legend` that also sets `FALSE` for each other legend.

### `paste()` with a zero-length argument returns length ONE, not zero
`paste0("x", character(0))` is `"x"`, so a key built per element gains one phantom member when the vector is empty; guard the empty case before building keys.

### `strsplit()` drops a trailing empty field, so a trailing separator vanishes
Leading empties survive and trailing ones do not, which is what makes it hard to reason about from memory.

### `identical()` on two reader results tests the reader, not the file
`identical(read_csv(f), read_csv(f))` can be **FALSE** for the same unchanged bytes: readr tibbles carry a `problems` attribute — an external pointer — that differs between reads (readr 2.2.0; `spec` is identical, measured).

### Under `R CMD check`, tests run from a temp dir against the INSTALLED package
Two shapes, both green under `devtools::test()` and broken under `R CMD check`, `devtools::check()`, a tarball check, or an installed-tests run — the direction that costs the most time.

### `dbConnect(SQLite(), path)` CREATES the file, so a read has a write side effect
SQLite creates a database on connect.

### CSV whitespace: `trim_ws` and `strip.white` do not do what the name suggests
- `readr::read_csv()` defaults to **`trim_ws = TRUE`** and silently strips leading and trailing whitespace.

### `R CMD check` rejects a filename containing a space
- "checking for portable file names" fails on any file in the built package whose name has a space.

### `sort()` and `order()` collate by `LC_COLLATE`, so a canonical form is locale-dependent
Character sorting in R is locale-sensitive by default, which makes any *canonical* string built by sorting — an XML node with its attributes ordered, a joined key, a manifest — a function of the session's locale rather than of the data:

### A library call that dispatches on a global option is not a pure function
A function whose *units* or *algorithm* are chosen by a session-wide setting behaves differently depending on what the caller did before reaching your code.

### `identical(-0, 0)` is TRUE in R, and the two still digest differently
A hash over R's serialized bytes — which is what `digest::digest()` takes by default — separates positive and negative zero, even though every value comparison says they are the same.

### Two repos pinning the same remote at different tags is an unsolvable install
`Remotes:` pins are per-repo, but resolution is global.

### `file(open = "wb", encoding = )` does not re-encode on write
The `encoding` argument to `file()` governs how bytes coming *in* are interpreted.

### A scalar helper called from `glue()` or `mutate()` recycles instead of erroring
`glue()` vectorises over its inputs.

### Never name a durable artifact by a hash the library reserves the right to change
`rlang::hash()` carries **no cross-version stability guarantee**, and rlang says so in its own NEWS for 1.3.0:

### `vapply(..., USE.NAMES = FALSE)` strips ALL dimnames, row names included
A named `FUN.VALUE` looks like it guarantees row names on the returned matrix.

### `source()`ing a config into the render environment leaks it into the next render
`source(params$config)` inside an Rmd puts every config value into the environment `render()` evaluates in.

### One very long table cell hangs paged.js, and it presents as a Chrome timeout
A ~600-character free-text field in a `kable` cell wedged `pagedown::chrome_print` indefinitely.

### `stats::aggregate()` has three separate silent behaviours, and each fails in a different direction
All three measured on R 4.5, all three met inside one 800-line script (drift#67).

### `stats::mad()` is already scaled to an SD
Use `stats::mad(x)` itself as the robust standard deviation, or `mad(x, constant = 1)` for the raw median absolute deviation: the default `constant = 1.4826` already scales it, so multiplying by 1.4826 again inflates the SD by half.

### `deparse(body(f))` excludes formal defaults, so a body scan cannot see a default
A guard that scans function bodies for a forbidden literal is blind to that literal in a **signature**.

### `deparse()` re-encodes non-ASCII, so it answers about itself rather than the file
Scan R source for non-ASCII the way `R CMD check` does (`tools:::.check_package_ASCII_code()`: raw lines, comments skipped), not through `parse()` and `deparse()`, which turn `\uXXXX` escapes into literal characters and back.

### `package_version()` errors on a pre-release version string
`package_version("3.9.0beta1")` raises rather than returning `NA`, so strip a pre-release suffix before asserting a version floor.

### `tryCatch(warning = )` DISCARDS the value the expression produced
A `warning =` handler is not a filter — it replaces the whole expression, so a call that **succeeded** and merely warned returns the handler's value and the result is thrown away.

### Do not abort inside a handler for a warning raised from C++; note it and abort after the call returns
Record a flag in the `withCallingHandlers()` handler, `invokeRestart("muffleWarning")`, and raise once the call has returned.

### `match()` treats NA as a matchable VALUE, so two unknowns join to each other
`match(NA, c("1", NA))` is **2**.

### `expect_message(expr, regexp)` checks only the FIRST condition, so a progress line hides the message under test
testthat 3e captures the first message the expression emits and matches the regexp against **that one**.

### `pak` refuses to install a package that needs no compiler
Install a pure-R package with `R CMD INSTALL <checkout>` when `pak::pak()` reports missing build tools: on macOS its check fails whenever `xcode-select -p` names Xcode.app and only the Command Line Tools are installed.

### `as.integer("NaN")` is `0`, and `as.integer(NaN)` is `NA`
The string round trip is the bug.

### `expect_false(identical(x, y))` cannot fail when the two are different types
`identical()` is type-strict, so it is already `FALSE` for any pair that differs in storage mode — and an assertion that the defect would make *true* then cannot fire.

### `unlist()` prefixes a `split()` group's name, so reassembling by name silently yields all-NA
Putting per-group results back in input order by naming them looks right and returns nothing:

### `tolerance` in testthat is RELATIVE, so it pins a published figure far more loosely than it looks
`expect_equal(x, 12.529, tolerance = 2e-2)` accepts anything within **two percent** — so a figure published to three decimals survives drifting to `12.629`.

### `cli` reads `{.name}` as a STYLE, not a variable, and a fold can swallow an interpolation
Two ways a `cli` message loses a value.

### `[[` on a named ATOMIC vector with an absent key is an error, not `NULL`
A list returns `NULL` for a missing `[[` key.

### `data.frame()` recycles a scalar against a zero-length column
It does not yield a 0-row frame — it raises, because a length-1 column and a length-0 column cannot be recycled together:

### A dot-prefixed column name can be swallowed by the verb's own formal
`mutate(x, .d = expr)` does not create a column called `.d`.

### `summarise()` and `mutate()` evaluate in order, so a later argument sees the summarised column
Once `frames = sum(frames)` has run, `frames` inside the next argument is that one-row sum, not the group's vector.

### `\<` and `\>` are word boundaries in R's default regex, not escaped `<` and `>`
Leave `<` and `>` unescaped when you build a pattern from data.

### `tempfile()` lives in the session tempdir, so a path printed in an error names a file R is about to delete
R removes its session `tempdir()` on exit, including after `stop()`.

### R's `yaml` returns a mixed int/float sequence as a list, not a numeric vector
`yaml::read_yaml()` simplifies a sequence to a vector only when every element has the same type, so `[0.164, 9999]` comes back as `list(0.164, 9999L)` while `[0.0, 9999.0]` is `c(0, 9999)`.

### testthat's failure snapshots land in `tests/` and ride in on `git add -A`
testthat 3e writes `tests/testthat/_problems/*.R` and `tests/testthat/testthat-problems.rds` when tests fail.

### Postgres row order is never fixed unless the query fixes it, so a pick, a float sum and a presence check can each depend on it
End every `ORDER BY` on a unique key, order any fetch whose rows are summed, and ask whether a value is loaded with an index walk, not `DISTINCT` or `EXISTS`.

### `sprintf("%g", x)` writes `Inf` and `NA` into SQL as bare words, which Postgres reads as column names
A numeric formatter such as `sprintf("%.10g", x)` has no SQL form for non-finite values.

### Verify a float-formatting fix in its consumer, not through `as.numeric()`
Compare where the literal is parsed (in Postgres, `SELECT <literal>::float8 = <stored>`) or compare IEEE 754 bytes: R's `as.numeric()` is not correctly rounded, so a correct `%.17g` string can fail to round-trip through R.

### An `information_schema` lookup by the literal table name misses what Postgres resolves
`WHERE table_schema = 's' AND table_name = 'T'` compares the text you passed.

### Rscript reads a script as it runs, so never edit a script while a run of it is in flight
Copy the script and run the copy (`cp scripts/x.R "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/x_frozen.R" && Rscript "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/x_frozen.R"`) for anything long-running, or leave the file alone until the run exits.

### A range total taken as the difference of two large running totals loses the small ranges
Sum a range directly (segment tree, per-range `sum()`, or grouped sums) rather than as `cumsum[hi] - cumsum[lo]` when ranges are small relative to the running total.

### A `pkg::` call in a test passes `devtools::test()` and fails `R CMD check` if `pkg` is undeclared
`R CMD check` warns "'::' or ':::' import not declared from" for any package a test reaches with `::` that `DESCRIPTION` does not list, and under `error-on: "warning"` that reddens every runner.

### Inside a dplyr verb, a column named like a local variable wins
Inject a local value into a data-masked verb with `!!x` or `.env$x`, never a bare `x`.

### `earthdatalogin`'s search and download calls overwrite the netrc when they find no Earthdata entry
Call NASA's CMR search with `curl` and download with `curl` given the netrc directly (`netrc = 1, netrc_file = <path>, cookiefile = ""` follows the URS redirect), or check `earthdatalogin:::has_edl_netrc()` yourself first.

### A fetcher's test helper must make the network fail, not just mock the reader
When a test mocks a downloader's reader and supplies fixture files, also mock the search and download functions to `stop()` by default, and re-mock them only in the tests that exercise that path.

### testthat 3e `expect_message()` returns the condition, not the expression's value
Assign inside the call, `expect_message(h <- f(x), "msg")`, never `h <- expect_message(f(x), "msg")`.

### `c()` dispatches on its first argument, so `c(NULL, <Date>)` is a plain number
Put a Date first when `c()` combines an optional piece with Dates: `c(NULL, <Date>)` takes the default method and returns a bare day count.

### `bind_rows()` of all-`NULL` is a 0 x 0 tibble, and a typed template must take its types from the rows' source
Bind per-group results under a zero-row template so an all-dropped result keeps its columns.

### `sample.int(prob =)` without replacement is not a probability-proportional draw, so weighting its result again double-counts
Draw a subsample to be design-weighted **uniformly** (`sample.int(n, k)`), or keep every unit.

### `system2(stdout = TRUE)` warns on a non-zero exit instead of raising, so a `tryCatch(error =)` around it never fires
Read the exit status off the result: `st <- attr(out, "status")`, which is `NULL` on success.

### Forked `parallel::mclapply()` workers segfault in `glm.fit` under macOS Accelerate BLAS
Fit models in parallel on socket workers (`parallel::makeCluster()` with `parLapply()`), not forks.

### `clusterApply()` returns `NULL` for no tasks, not an empty list
Guard an empty input before naming or indexing a `clusterApply()` or `clusterApplyLB()` result: given zero tasks both return `NULL`, where `parLapply()` and `lapply()` return `list()`.

### `c(name = x)` keeps `x`'s own name, so a value from a named vector becomes `name.X`
Strip the name before you label it: `c(axis = unname(v[1]))` or `c(axis = v[[1]])`.

### `trace(exit =)` also fires when the function raises, and `returnValue()` then has no value
Give `returnValue()` a default and check its length: `trace(f, exit = quote(rec(returnValue(NULL))))`, then treat anything not length 1 as "no value".

### `Rscript -e` supplies `--args` itself, so adding your own shifts every argument by one
Write `Rscript -e 'expr' a b`, not `Rscript -e 'expr' --args a b`.

### `read.delim()` quotes by default, so a `"` in a field silently swallows rows
Read a TSV you wrote unquoted with `quote = "", na.strings = character(), comment.char = ""`.

### duckdb in R: the query that autoloads `icu` binds unreliably, so `LOAD icu` before it
Run `LOAD icu` on the connection before any query that needs it (`epoch()`, `year()`, a cast to `DATE` on a `TIMESTAMPTZ`), or use a function that needs no extension (`epoch_ms()`).

### `fs::path()` collapses the `//` after a URL scheme, so it cannot build URLs
Join a URL with `paste(base, key, sep = "/")` or `file.path()`, never `fs::path()`.

### R's default curl user-agent fails on canada.ca, and the error names HTTP/2, not the agent
Set a user-agent on every R fetch of a `canada.ca` page, because R's default fails there with an HTTP/2 error that never mentions the agent.

### `climr::downscale()` returns its reference-period row even with `return_refperiod = FALSE`
Keep only the observed series (`DATASET == "<obs_ts_dataset>"`, four-digit `PERIOD`) before averaging climr output over years.

### A `function(...)` mock hides arguments the real callee no longer accepts
Stubbing a callee with `function(...) invisible("mock")` accepts any argument name, so a wrapper still passing a parameter the callee dropped stays green while every real call errors with `unused argument`.

### `expect_message(regexp = "...$")` never matches, because `message()` appends `"\n"`
The condition message carries the trailing newline, so an end anchor fails and the test reports "did not throw a message" even though the message printed.

### `load_all()` refuses an installed dependency below the `Imports:` floor, so measure old-against-new from a frozen worktree
Run the old-dependency side of a before/after comparison from a `git worktree` of the pre-bump commit, and install the new version only after those runs finish.

### `tryCatch()` nests its handlers, so a `stop()` in one is caught by a later one
Record the condition in the handler (`hit <<- TRUE`) and raise after `tryCatch()` returns.

### `fs::file_move()` onto an existing directory nests the source inside it
Move a directory into place with `base::file.rename()` and check its return value, which is FALSE where the target is a non-empty directory, a symlink or a file.

### Base `file.info()` has no inode column, so `file.info(x)$ino` is NULL and any comparison of it passes
Read an inode with `fs::file_info(x)$inode`.

### `cffr::cff_create()` writes a CRAN DOI for any package that shares a name with a CRAN package
Drop the generated DOI (`x$doi <- NULL`) unless it is your own, and supply your own through `keys = list(doi = ...)`.

### A `{python}` chunk needs reticulate even with `eval = FALSE`
Set `python.reticulate = FALSE` on a Python chunk that only displays code, or declare reticulate.

### `readBin(size = 4)` returns NA for exactly 2^31, so it cannot read an unsigned 32-bit field
Sum the bytes as doubles (`sum(as.numeric(raw[i + 1:4]) * 256^(0:3))`) to read a u32 or u64 from a binary header.

### ajv honours keywords beside a `$ref`; Python's jsonschema ignores them
Keep every `$ref` alone in a draft-07 schema tested with jsonvalidate and read by pystac.

### `load_all()` runs every `.R` file at the top of a package's `data/` as a data script
Keep helper and ad hoc scripts out of `data/`, which pkgload treats as package data, so `load_all()` sources any `data/*.R` it finds there.

### `ifelse()` with an all-NA test returns a logical vector, whatever `yes` and `no` are
Resolve NA before an `ifelse()` whose result must keep a type (`blocked <- !is.na(blocked) & blocked`), or use `dplyr::if_else(..., missing = )`.

### `sub()` takes one replacement, not one per element
Paste a per-element suffix on instead (`paste0(sub("]$", "", x), suffix)`): a `replacement` longer than one is used as its first element everywhere, with only a warning.

# Code Check — Shell
Tool-level traps in bash, sed, git and `gh`, and in the host toolchain those commands depend on.

*Index only: each rule's heading and first sentence. The full text is soul's `conventions/code-check-shell.md`; read it before writing or reviewing code in its area. `/code-check` loads it in full.*

### `git diff a..b` compares TIPS; a change on `a` shows up as the branch's
Use three-dot `git diff a...b` for what a branch changed; two-dot compares the tips, so changes that landed on `a` show up as the branch's, inverted.

### git pathspec excludes: use the long form
- `:!path` is short-form magic, and git keeps parsing magic characters after the `!`.

### `sed 1d f1 f2 f3` strips only the FIRST file's header
`sed` treats multiple file arguments as one concatenated stream, so a line-address script applies once across the whole set rather than per file.

### `sed -n '/X/,$d' file` prints nothing at all
`-n` suppresses auto-print, and `d` only deletes — so nothing is ever emitted and the output is empty.

### Reading a file line-by-line drops the last line without a trailing newline
- `while IFS= read -r line; do ...; done < file` skips a final line that has no newline after it.

### Empty arrays under `set -u` on bash 3.2
- macOS still ships bash **3.2**, where `"${ARR[@]}"` on an empty array is an unbound-variable error under `set -u`.

### Quoting
- Variables in double-quoted strings containing single quotes break if value has `'`

### Heredoc precedence in pipelines
- `cmd1 | cmd2 <<EOF` — the heredoc binds to `cmd2` (the rightmost simple command).

### A heredoc whose body contains its own delimiter ends early, and the rest runs as shell
Give an outer heredoc a delimiter its body cannot contain, or run the script from a file.

### Paths
- Hardcoded absolute paths (`/Users/<name>/...`) break for other users

### Diagnose env/PATH problems in the shell that actually runs, not the ambient one
- Get ground truth **before** forming any theory: `env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM bash -lc 'echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n" | nl'` (swap in `zsh` to check the other side).

### Parallel writers sharing one output file interleave mid-record
- `xargs -P N ... >> shared_file` (or any fan-out where N processes append to the same fd/path) is only safe while each record fits in a single `write()`.

### `mktemp` template needs enough X's, and a failed `mktemp` leaves an empty var
- BSD/macOS `mktemp -d -t <name>` requires the template to contain at least 3 `X`s (`XXXXXX` is the safe default).

### `cmd dir/*` dies on ARG_MAX at scale — and only after the expensive work succeeded
- A glob expands to argv.

### A `curl` in a parallel fan-out needs `--max-time`
- Without it, one hung connection pins a worker slot indefinitely.

### BSD vs GNU sed/grep portability (macOS hits this constantly)
- macOS ships BSD `sed`/`grep`.

### On this Mac `stat` and `date` are GNU, so the same flag letter means something else
Here Homebrew puts GNU coreutils ahead of `/usr/bin`, so BSD-style `stat -f` and `date -r <epoch>` mean something else; prefer a flavour-free form (`find -newermt`, `python3`), or call the binary by absolute path.

### `&` binds to the whole `&&` list, so assignments never reach the parent
- `cmd1 && VAR=$(...) && nohup prog > "$VAR.log" & disown` backgrounds the **entire list**, not just `nohup`.

### `gh` CLI
- **`gh pr create` resolves branch from CWD, not `--repo`**.

### On a fork, `main` may track upstream by design — comparing it answers nothing
`gh api repos/ORG/REPO/compare/upstream:main...ORG:main` returning `ahead: 0, behind: 0, status: identical` reads as *"this fork has no local work"*.

### A destructive setup and its undo must not share one timeout-able command
Never chain a destructive setup and its undo (`git stash && slow && git stash pop`) in one timeout-able command; compare with `git show HEAD:path`, or restore from one `trap … EXIT` handler guarded by a flag set once the setup happened.

### `git checkout <path>` restores from the index, not from HEAD
After a `git add`, `git checkout <path>` reinstates the broken *staged* copy — so the "fix" reproduces the failure and reads as though the edit was wrong.

### Six git plumbing calls whose default answers a different question
Pass the flag that names the question you mean: `git log -m` and `--name-only`, `update-ref HEAD`, a checkout over an ignored file, `rev-parse --git-path` and a check of the `*_HEAD` files each succeed having answered or written something else.

### A value validated with one numeric grammar and consumed with another
Normalise a numeric string once (digits only and at most 9 of them, then `x=$((10#$x))`, then a bounded range): `test` reads base 10, `$(( ))` reads a leading zero as octal and wraps past 2^63.

### `wait` with no argument waits for every background job in the shell
Wait on the PIDs you started (`wait "$pid"`), because a bare `wait` also blocks on every other background job in the shell.

### `if ! cmd; then rc=$?` captures the negation, not the command
Inside the branch, `$?` is the status of the `!` compound — which is **0 by construction**, because the negation succeeded.

### A `pgrep -f` waiter matches its own command line, so it never exits
Wait on a PID with `while kill -0 "$PID"; do sleep 30; done`, never on `pgrep -f "job"`, whose pattern matches the waiting loop's own command line so it never exits.

### `timeout` is GNU coreutils — a portable deadline
An assertion around something that might hang can only pass or hang, never fail (`code-check.md`, "Restore the bug and prove the guard fires").

### `aws s3 cp` cannot tell a missing key from a missing bucket
`aws s3 cp` gives one exit 1 and 404 text for a missing key and a missing bucket, so probe `s3api head-bucket` then `head-object`: only a 404 from a reachable bucket means absent; a 403 is permissions.

### An S3 multipart ETag depends on the uploader's part size, so try every size that gives its part count
Verify an upload by comparing each object's ETag with its file, trying for a multipart ETag every part size that gives its part count: the size is the uploader's `multipart_chunksize`, which differs between machines.

### A verification command can be shadowed by a shell function or alias
- The shell is initialized from the user's profile, so `diff`, `grep`, `ls`, `cat` and friends may resolve to a wrapper rather than the binary you assume.

### `pwd` keeps typed case; key on `env pwd -P`
Key on `env pwd -P`.

### psql does not interpolate `:'var'` inside a dollar-quoted string, and `\quit N` exits 0
Two traps in the same file type, both of which read perfectly and fail at run time.

### A second `trap … EXIT` replaces the first
`trap` registers **one** handler per signal.

### A `local` statement cannot read a variable it is assigning in the same statement
`local a="$1" lab="$2" m="/tmp/marker_${lab}"` expands `${lab}` **before** `lab` is assigned.

### Inside an `EnterWorktree` session, the Bash tool refuses command text that names git
The harness applies an isolation guard to a session that entered a worktree: *"a worktree-isolated session's git operations must target its own worktree."*

### A `git filter-repo` seed carries the source repo's tags, and a path sed misses the language's path constructor
Two traps from seeding one repo out of another's history (2026-09-02), both silent.

### `git check-ignore -v` prints the matching pattern, and its exit status is not a per-file verdict
`-v` reports the **last matching pattern**, negations included.

### `sips -Z` scales up as well as down
`sips -Z N` resamples so the longest side is N — in **either** direction.

### Assert capabilities, not versions — a tool upgrade can remove one silently
A tool upgrade across the fleet can remove a capability without reporting failure.

### An amd64-only image needs `--platform`, and it works on your machine because it is cached
`docker run` resolves from the local image store before it reaches a registry, so on an arm64 Mac an amd64-only image runs fine once pulled — **and the command that pulled it is not necessarily the one in the code.**

### Headless Qt in a container needs `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, and without it the run hangs or crashes
Pass `-e QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` to any `docker run` that starts QGIS or another Qt program with no display.

### `s3cmd ls` given several paths lists only the FIRST, and says nothing
Query one path per `s3cmd ls` call, or `--recursive` on the prefix and `grep`: given several paths it lists only the first, with exit 0.

### `grep -c` prints the count AND exits 1 when it is zero
Write `n=$(grep -c …) || n=0`, never `|| echo 0` inside the substitution: `grep -c` already prints `0` and exits 1, so that fallback appends a second line, while the bare assignment aborts a `set -e` script.

### A failed `git fetch` leaves the comparison you make next reading stale refs
`git fetch` and the check that follows it are two commands, and nothing links them.

### macOS `/usr/bin/awk` aborts when a regex meets a byte slice that cuts a multibyte character
Test a `substr()` slice with `==`, never with `~`, `match()` or `sub()`: the stock macOS awk counts bytes in `substr()` but converts a regex operand to wide characters, and a partial UTF-8 sequence kills the whole program.

### macOS `sed` dies on an invalid byte, and GNU sed misparses it
Parse logs with `LC_ALL=C sed`: a regex that scans an invalid UTF-8 byte exits 1 on macOS and misparses silently with GNU sed.

### A variable in a sed replacement is parsed, so its `\` and `&` are not literal
Never interpolate data into the replacement half of `sed "s#…#$var#"`: sed reads `\(` as `(`, and `&` as the whole match, so the line written is not the value held.

### A fetch can fail and still deliver the commit, so when you need an object, test the object
When the goal is a specific commit, resolve its sha first (`git ls-remote`) and test `git cat-file -e "$sha^{commit}"` after the fetch rather than the fetch's exit status.

### A default `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` outranks the machine's own ssh choice
Supply a default ssh command only when `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `core.sshCommand` and `GIT_SSH` are all unset.

### `curl -o` without `-L` saves the redirect page as the download
`curl` does not follow redirects unless it is given `-L`, and it exits 0 on a 3xx.

### `conda run` captures its child's output, so a pipe gets nothing
`conda run -n env cmd` buffers the child's stdout and re-emits it, and that re-emission does not reach a pipe.

### `exit` inside a loop condition ends the shell, not the test
Count instead: `while :; do left=0; for i in $ids; do done_yet "$i" || left=$((left+1)); done; [ "$left" -eq 0 ] && break; sleep 90; done`.

### A failed `cd` lets every later command run in the directory you were already in
Write `cd "$D" || exit 1` (or `cd "$D" && …`), never `cd "$D"; …`: without the guard, a missing directory prints one error and the rest of the line runs wherever the shell stood, including its file writes.

### macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2 quote-matches a heredoc inside `$( )`, so an apostrophe in the body is a syntax error
Pass multi-line text through a file (`--body-file`, `-F`), never `"$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF)"`: bash 3.2 matches quotes inside `$( )` before it reads the heredoc, so an unpaired apostrophe in the body is a syntax error.

### A skill's bash blocks run as separate calls, and its `$` + digits are replaced by its arguments
Open every block after the first with guards on what it inherits: re-set its variables, confirm the path is the expected tree, and refuse edits or commits the previous block did not check.

### An apostrophe in a `${VAR:?message}` inside double quotes is an unterminated quote
Keep apostrophes out of the message of a `"${VAR:?…}"` guard (`the REL: line of step 5`, not `step 5's REL: line`): bash 3.2 and 5 both read the `'` as opening a quote, and the whole script fails to parse before the guard can run.

### A `git push` can land and still report failure, so confirm the ref rather than the exit code
After a rejected push, read the remote ref before concluding anything: `git fetch -q origin && git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/<branch>`.

### Over Tailscale SSH to a Mac, `ssh` exits 0 whatever the remote command returned
Never branch on the exit status of `ssh <mac-host> cmd` when the host serves Tailscale SSH: test what the command prints (`ssh host 'test -e f && echo YES'` compared to `YES`), or move the loop to the remote side and gate on its output.

### awk `==` compares version strings as numbers, so `1.1` matches `1.10`
Compare a field to a version as strings, `($i "") == (v "")`: awk gives `split()` fields, `$i` and `-v` values string-or-number status, so when both sides look numeric `==` compares numbers, and `1.1 == 1.10` and `2.0 == 2` are true.

### `gh api` prints an HTTP error's body on stdout and exits 1, ignoring `--jq`
Branch on `gh api`'s exit status before reading its output.

### Put cleanup on the EXIT trap, not RETURN: a shell killed by a signal never runs RETURN
Clean up temp files and worktrees in one EXIT handler that reads globals.

### `git worktree prune` deregisters every missing worktree in the repo, not only yours
Remove only your own registration: `git worktree remove --force "$wt"`, and on failure delete only its admin dir (`git -C "$wt" rev-parse --absolute-git-dir`, captured right after `worktree add`).

### `git push --porcelain` ends with `Done` on a rejection, so `tail -1` names no reason
Take the reason from the `!` row's third tab field, falling back to the last line that is not `Done`: `awk -F'\t' '$1 == "!" { print $3; exit }'`.

### In a Perl replacement, `$1` followed by a digit is a different group
Write `${1}` whenever the text after a backreference starts with a digit: Perl reads `$1281399` as group 1281399, which does not exist, so the replacement is empty and the run exits 0.

### `for x in $(cmd | grep … || true)` hides a failing `cmd`
Assign the command on its own line under `set -e` (`out=$(cmd)`), then filter `out` with `|| true`.

### A sed/awk range can run to EOF
Never pipe a `sed`/`awk` range extract into an interpreter.

### A Python CLI redirected to a log writes nothing until it exits, so the log cannot show progress
Run a long Python command with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` (or `python -u`) when its output goes to a file: stdout to a file is block-buffered, so the log stays at 0 bytes for the whole run and an empty log reads as a stalled job.

### `aws s3` progress lines end in `\r`, so a line-based count of a saved log reads zero
Translate before counting: `tr '\r' '\n' < log | grep -c '^upload:'`.

### `a && b || c` runs `c` when any step before the `||` fails
Give each setup step its own `|| exit 1` and branch with `if`: in `a && b || c`, `c` runs when `a` fails as well as when `b` does, so a failed setup reaches the fallback with its variable unset.

# Code Check — Spatial
terra, sf, bcdata, GDAL/OGR CLIs.

*Index only: each rule's heading and first sentence. The full text is soul's `conventions/code-check-spatial.md`; read it before writing or reviewing code in its area. `/code-check` loads it in full.*

### Negative coordinates get parsed as CLI options — every BC bbox hits this
- BC longitudes are all negative, so `--bounds -124.73 49.485 -124.595 49.565` fails with `Error: No such option: -1`.

### bcdata: an empty result raises AttributeError, it does not return an empty collection
- A bbox query matching nothing exits non-zero with `AttributeError: You are calling a geospatial method on the GeoDataFrame, but the active geometry column to use has not been set.` — geopandas complaining about an empty frame, several layers below the query.

### bcdata: `filter()` translates the calls inside it, so build strings, value lists and transforms before the query
Compute any query string, value list or transformed geometry into a variable before `bcdata::filter()`, or wrap the call in `local()`.

### terra: operator dispatch and edge cases in package code
- **SpatRaster `%in%` is not dispatched when terra is *imported* (only when *attached*).**

### A classed abort raised while computing an argument to a terra S4 generic loses its class
Compute an argument whose evaluation can abort before calling the terra generic: `pre <- f(); post <- g(); terra::cover(pre, post)`, never `terra::cover(f(), g())`.

### terra: `extract()` returns no row for ground beyond the raster, and counts cells by centre
- Two traps in one call, and both make a partial result look complete.

### A `...` constructor may discard trailing arguments based on the class of the first one
- A constructor that takes `...` is free to branch on **what its first argument is** and build the result from that alone.

### terra: `mask()` is `touches = TRUE`, so two "clip to the polygon" routines disagree by a cell ring
Swapping one polygon clip for another looks like a refactor and is a **methodology change**.

### terra: `sources()` on a derived raster is `""` or a random temp path, never the input
- A raster that came out of `crop()`, `project()`, `mask()`, or arithmetic is **derived**, so it has no source file.

### `sf::st_as_binary()` returns a LIST of raw vectors, so `is.raw()` on it is FALSE
The obvious way to feed WKB into a canonicalizer is a `is.raw(x)` branch that hex-encodes it.

### Canonicalize geometry before hashing it — ring order and orientation are not fixed by topology
`code-check.md`'s cache-key row prescribes hashing WKB (`sf::st_as_binary(sf::st_geometry(x), endian = "little")`) rather than the sfc object.

### sf: `st_join(largest = TRUE)` ignores the join predicate
`st_join(largest = TRUE)` matches by intersection area whatever `join =` says, and drops zero-area geometries, so point and line overlays cannot use it.

### sf: name validation must account for the geometry column
- The active geometry column is a named entry in `names(x)`, but its name is **not fixed** — `"geometry"` from `sf::st_read()` of some sources, `"geom"` from a GeoPackage/PostGIS layer, `"geometry"` or `"_ogr_geometry_"` elsewhere.

### sf: `st_intersection()` / `st_difference()` return a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION that QGIS will not draw
- Intersecting or differencing two polygon layers yields a `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` wherever the inputs *also* touch along a line or at a point.

### sf: reproject the polygon to get a lat/lon bbox, never transform the projected bbox corners
- To hand a geographic (EPSG:4326) bounding box to a bbox-filtered query (WFS/OGC features, `?bbox=`), reproject the whole AOI **geometry** then take its bbox: `sf::st_bbox(sf::st_transform(aoi, 4326))`.

### An offset regex must be anchored to a time, or a date looks like a zone
- Refusing or stripping a trailing UTC offset with something like `[+-][0-9]{2}(:?[0-9]{2})?$` also matches the end of a plain ISO date: `"2026-08-15"` ends in `-15`, which reads as a −15 hour zone.

### A reader that accepts a UTC offset may not be applying it
GDAL accepts a UTC offset in a GeoPackage `DATETIME` and silently drops it, returning wall-clock digits that are then read in the machine's zone, so one file gives a different instant on every machine.

### Ask the file about its field names, not R
`sf::st_read()` returns a data frame, and R makes column names syntactic on the way in.

### QGIS embeds a layer's style in the `.qgs`, so rewriting the `.qml` sidecar changes nothing
A `.qgs` carries each layer's style **inside** its `<maplayer>` node — the sidecar's children are copied in when the layer is declared.

### A QGIS value map's empty choice is a fixed GUID value; its `<NULL>` label is editable
When reading a value map's choices from a `.qml` or `.qgs`, drop QGIS's empty choice by its value, `{2839923C-8B7D-419E-B84B-CA2FE9B80EC7}`, not by its `<NULL>` label, which a form author can edit.

### A GeoPackage is a SQLite database, and that leaks in three ways
Writing to one directly (a `layer_styles` row, an attribute fix) is a plain `INSERT` and needs no GDAL.

### The same leak reaches R and OGR SQL, and a GeoPackage's bytes are not its content
Edit a live GeoPackage through GDAL (`ogrinfo -sql`) rather than RSQLite, and assert row state rather than `dbExecute()`'s count, which includes trigger writes.

### Restoring a GeoPackage from a copy: refuse sidecars before the first read, delete them before the copy-back
A byte copy of the main file is a snapshot only when no `-journal`, `-wal` or `-shm` exists and the header is in rollback mode (bytes 18-19 = `01 01`).

### A coordinate stored as an attribute can disagree with the geometry it describes
A spatial layer that also carries `LATITUDE` / `LONGITUDE` columns has the same fact twice, and nothing keeps them consistent.

### GeoJSON in a projected CRS is silently non-portable
`sf::st_write()` and `ogr2ogr` will write GeoJSON from a projected object and emit a `crs` member naming it:

### `sf::st_perimeter()` needs lwgeom on projected data, and lwgeom is not a dependency of sf
An exported sf function whose body branches on `requireNamespace("lwgeom")` is an undeclared dependency: `R CMD check` does not report it, and a test suite cannot see it on a machine that happens to have lwgeom installed.

### terra keeps a result in memory whenever it fits, so a per-class loop over a large grid accumulates full-grid rasters
`ifel()`, `focal()`, arithmetic and `rasterize()` return in-memory SpatRasters whenever the result fits under `memfrac` (60% of RAM by default).

### `geom_sf(data = NULL)` draws nothing, silently
A `NULL` `data` argument does not error and does not warn — the layer inherits the plot's data, which for `ggplot()` with no global data is empty, so it contributes a **zero-row layer**.

### terra: `app()` calls a vector-tolerant `fun` once per CELL, and reads a 5-column return on a 5-column raster as transposed
Two contracts inside `terra::app()` that read as the opposite of what they are, both measured on terra 1.9.34 (drift#9, 2026-09-05):

### terra: `levels<-` and `coltab<-` copy first; `set.cats()` mutates in place, setting or stripping
`terra::set.cats()` mutates the raster it is given whether it strips (`value = NULL`) or sets levels; `levels<-` and `coltab<-` deep-copy first, so on a caller's raster call `set.cats()` only on the copy one of them returned, or on a `deepcopy()` you own.

### terra `metags()`: the empty case is `NULL`, and the sidecar is half the artefact
Three measured facts about raster **container** metadata, all of which fail quietly (floodplains#83, 2026-09-05, terra 1.9.34 / GDAL 3.8.5).

### terra `metags<-` merges into the tags a raster already has, and its setters work only from 1.8-54
To replace a raster's dataset tags, clear them first (`metags(x) <- NULL`, only when there are any) and then set, and require `terra (>= 1.8-54)`.

### `ggmap`: a fixed `zoom` silently crops points off the basemap, and `calc_zoom()` does not fix it
`ggmap::get_map()` fetches ONE fixed-size image at whatever `zoom` it is given.

### terra: `zonal()` outside its six-function fast path materializes the WHOLE grid in R
`terra::zonal()` dispatches to C++ only when `fun` is one of `max`, `min`, `mean`, `sum`, `notNA`, `isNA`.

### sf: close a rotated ring by copying the first vertex, never by recomputing it
Rotating a polygon by multiplying its whole vertex matrix — `xy %*% rot` — looks exact, and for a ring built closed it is not.

### terra: `plot(type = "classes", levels =, col =)` maps colours by POSITION, per layer
A `levels`/`col` pair is not a value-to-colour mapping.

### terra: `wrap()` carries the tempfile basename in `varnames`, so a committed artifact churns
Set `varnames` and `longnames` before `wrap()` or writing a raster produced with `filename = tempfile()`, or the random tempfile basename makes a committed artifact change on every run.

### `terra::plot()` leaves the device in a state where a keyword-placed `legend()` draws nothing
`graphics::legend("topleft", …)` after a `terra::plot()` or `terra::plotRGB()` **silently draws nothing** — no error, no warning, and the rest of the figure renders normally.

### A name is not a key: `GNIS_NAME` matches features all over BC
`filter(GNIS_NAME == "Buck Creek")` returns every Buck Creek in the province.

### `sf::st_read()` on a KML drops `<SchemaData>`, silently
GDAL has two KML drivers and picks `KML` by default, which does not read the `<SchemaData>` block.

### GDAL applies `-srcnodata` and an alpha mask together, and the mask loses
Two ways of saying "these pixels are not data" reach `gdalwarp` independently, and giving it both is not an error — it is an instruction to do both.

### Check an alpha-masked raster by its mask flags, not its colorinterp
Assert that rasterio's `ds.mask_flag_enums` is `[per_dataset, alpha]` on every image band, as an absolute check.

### `parallel::mclapply()` over a remote raster aborts every fork on macOS, and the wrapper exits 0
GDAL's curl handles do not survive a fork.

### terra: `align()` defaults to `snap = "near"`, so the aligned window need not contain the input
`terra::align(e, r)` snaps each edge of `e` to the **nearest** cell boundary of `r`, which moves an edge *inward* as readily as outward.

### GDAL reserves 3,276 MB per process before reading a cell, and PSOCK workers outlive their master
Two independent reasons a parallel raster job uses far more memory than its data, both measured 2026-09-20 on a 64 GB machine (fly#58) while a sweep was killed four times.

### `terra::distance(x, target = NA)` measures FROM the NA cells, so every data cell reads 0
Reaching for it to answer "how far is each data cell from the nearest nodata" gives the opposite: `distance()` fills the **target** cells with their distance to the nearest non-target, so data cells come back `0` and any `dist < threshold` test is true everywhere.

### `summarise()` on a grouped `sf` returns an `sf`, and the geometry rides into your CSV
`dplyr::summarise()` dispatches to `summarise.sf` on an `sf` object.

### A raster's drawn footprint is its valid data, not its extent
Before comparing a rendered shape against a raster, get the raster's valid-data window, not its bbox.

### `sf::gdal_utils()` does not raise when GDAL cannot open the source
Test the result for `character(0)` or `NA` before parsing it.

### A shift measured on one grid is wrong when applied on another
Apply a displacement in the CRS it was measured in: transform the point there, add the shift, transform back.

### Writing KML: `<color>` is `aabbggrr`, and a remote icon href renders nothing offline
Do the hex swap in **one** helper and omit `<Icon><href>` entirely.

### `rio cogeo validate` exits 0 when the file is NOT a valid COG
It reports the verdict in text and returns success either way, so the exit status carries no information at all:

### `terra::rast()` on a SpatRaster returns an empty template, not a copy
Pass a SpatRaster through as is (`if (inherits(x, "SpatRaster")) x else terra::rast(x)`): `rast(x)` on one returns a template with the same geometry and **no values**.

### terra integer rasters: `rasterize(filename =)` writes the background as 0, and `project()` keeps NoData as data
Rasterise in memory and then `writeRaster(datatype = …)`, and cast an integer raster to float (`x * 1`) before `terra::project()`.

### GDAL's `average` warp across a rotated CRS weights the wrong pixels; average in the target CRS instead
To take class fractions or means from a fine grid in one CRS onto a coarse grid in another, resample nearest onto a grid aligned with the target and `fact` times finer (`terra::disagg(terra::rast(target), fact)`), then `terra::aggregate(fact, mean)`.

### `terra::densify()` on lon/lat follows great circles, so a raster extent's parallel edges bow poleward
Pass `flat = TRUE` (with the interval in degrees) when densifying a lon/lat extent before projecting it.

### Planetary Computer STAC: a floodplain-scale read hits three limits a reach never does
Query a large AOI by its convex hull, re-sign items before each tile, and give `datetime` explicit times (`…T00:00:00Z/…T23:59:59Z`).

### gdalcubes records only a failed image OPEN; check `chunk_status`, and know what it misses
Read the `chunk_status` variable of every `write_ncdf()` output with ncdf4 and abort on any value other than 0 or the netCDF int fill, and abort after the call returns on the R warning `could not be added to output`.

### `gdalcubes::cube_view()` reads an aggregation or resampling it does not know as a default, with no error
Validate `aggregation` and `resampling` against sets measured by round-tripping each value through `cube_view()`, not against `?cube_view`.

### terra reads a multi-variable gdalcubes NetCDF with its variables in alphabetical order
Select layers by name after `terra::rast()` of a `gdalcubes::write_ncdf()` output, never by position.

### terra's COG writer emits a `.aux.json` sidecar when the raster carries a time
Strip `time` (and `units`, `varnames`, `longnames`, `metags`, `scoff`) before `writeRaster(filetype = "COG")`, or have the publisher move `<file>.aux.json` with the raster.

### `sf::st_read()` promotes a mixed POLYGON/MULTIPOLYGON layer to all-MULTIPOLYGON
Read with `promote_to_multi = FALSE` whenever a layer will be written back.

### `sf::st_make_valid()` rewrites geometry that was already valid
Run it on the invalid rows only (`!st_is_valid(x)`), or keep the original geometry and use the made-valid copy just for the computation.

### `st_union()` fails after `st_transform()` of a source mixing XY and XYZ rings
Drop Z with `sf::st_zm()` before any `st_union()` or `st_combine()` on data that may mix XY and XYZ rings and has been through `st_transform()`.

### terra: `unique()` and `freq()` on a factor return its labels, not its codes
Read a factor raster's codes from a copy with its levels stripped (`levels(y) <- NULL`), never from `terra::unique(x)[, 1]` or `terra::freq(x)$value`, which on a factor return the active category's labels.

### A GDAL failure partway through `sf::st_read()` returns the rows read so far, with only a warning
Treat any warning during a read whose completeness matters as a failed read: wrap it in `withCallingHandlers(st_read(...), warning = function(w) stop(...))`, retry, then stop.

### `terra::project()` over a remote strip-organised TIFF issues a range request per strip, so download it first
Check `gdalinfo` for `Block=<width>x1` before reading a remote raster through `/vsicurl/`, and where it is strip-organised (one row per block, no overviews) download the whole file to a tempfile and read that.

### LidarBC tiles can carry an undeclared nodata of -3.4e38, which a mean takes as data
Clamp a LidarBC DEM or DSM to plausible elevations before any aggregate: `terra::clamp(r, -100, 5000, values = FALSE)`.

### bcdata returns a column whose values are all missing as character, not numeric
Coerce every field you do arithmetic on (`as.numeric(v$PROJ_AGE_1)`) right after `bcdata::collect()`.

### The BC WFS caps an un-paged `GetFeature` at 10,000 features and still answers HTTP 200
Hold any raw WFS read to the server's own count.

### bcdata's error text does not carry a WFS failure's cause, so read it from the response
To tell a throttle from any other bcdata failure, record the status off the request itself (wrap `crul:::crul_fetch`), not from the message.

### sf and terra can link different GDALs, so a probe through one says nothing about the other
Check `sf::sf_extSoftVersion()[["GDAL"]]` and `terra::gdal()` before concluding that "GDAL" cannot read something: one R session can hold two GDALs, and a driver or codec missing from one may be present in the other.

### `arrow::write_parquet()` of a geoarrow table is not GeoParquet
Write GeoParquet with GDAL's Parquet driver (`ogr2ogr -f Parquet`), and check the file's schema metadata carries a `geo` key.

### `atan2(0, 0)` is 0, so two points at one place have a bearing of due north
Treat a zero-length step as having no heading: test the step length before taking its azimuth, and return `NA` rather than a bearing when it is 0, because `atan2(0, 0)` returns 0 with no warning, and that reads as north.

### gdalwarp writes INTO an existing destination and keeps its grid
Delete the output before re-warping to the same path (`unlink(out)` before `sf::gdal_utils("warp", ...)`, or pass `-overwrite`).

### GDAL caches a failed `/vsicurl/` open, so an in-process retry sends no request
Before retrying a `/vsicurl/` read in the same process, set `CPL_VSIL_CURL_NON_CACHED` to the URL's prefix.

### THREDDS NCSS returns one time step unless the request says `temporal=all`
Add `&temporal=all` (or an explicit `time_start`/`time_end`) to every NetCDF Subset Service grid request.

### BC's water rights licence view repeats a row per licensee, so deduplicate before summing quantities
Keep one row per licence, purpose, point of diversion, `QUANTITY_FLAG` and units before summing `QUANTITY` from `WHSE_WATER_MANAGEMENT.WLS_WATER_RIGHTS_LICENCES_SV`.

### QGIS cannot draw Esri Wayback, and a Wayback release date is not a capture date
Fetch Wayback imagery with GDAL or curl into a local raster, choosing the release by its **capture** date (from the release's `metadataLayerUrl`), never by its release date.

### A VRT composites over a source's mask band, so overlapping chips must be clipped with nodata
Clip overlapping rasters bound for one VRT with a nodata value, not a mask band: a VRT honours a source's nodata when it composites and ignores its mask, so the source listed last overwrites its neighbour.

### Test HTTP range support by a 206, not by `Accept-Ranges`
Trust a `Range` GET's `206`, not a HEAD's `Accept-Ranges`, and refuse a `200` (the whole object).

### A label slice that ends exactly on a grid edge drops that edge when the stored coordinates drift
Pad a label slice by half a cell (`sel(latitude=slice(60.05, 47.95))`, not `slice(60, 48)`) and assert the cell count of the result before fetching anything.

### `terra::cells(r, lines, touches = FALSE)` gives each line's own cells, so a shared cell can belong to both
Take per-feature cell membership from `terra::cells(r, terra::vect(x), touches = FALSE)`, which returns an `ID` (row of `x`) and `cell` for exactly the cells `rasterize(touches = FALSE)` burns.

### A Freshwater Atlas main stem's downstream end lies on the receiving river's centreline, not at the confluence
Do not use the `DOWNSTREAM_ROUTE_MEASURE = 0` point of a tributary's main stem as its mouth on the ground.

### `terra::project()` given only a CRS lets GDAL and PROJ choose the grid and the datum step, and their choices move between versions
Pass `terra::project()` a template grid, and between east/north NAD83 CRSs a pinned `pipeline`, when a reprojection must reproduce.

### pystac `Collection.add_item()` rewrites the item's self href and fetches the root over the network
Re-set the item's self href after `add_item()`, and call `collection.set_root(collection)` once its self href is set.

### `pdist::pdist()` loses centimetres at projected coordinates
Subtract a local origin before `pdist::pdist()`: at BC Albers magnitudes it returns 0 for points up to 7 cm apart.

### FWA `upstream_route_measure` misses the next segment's start
Take a segment's top from the next segment's `downstream_route_measure`, and compare measures from different sources within 1 mm.

### FWA main flow is not edge type 1000 alone
Select main flow with `edge_type IN (1000, 1050, 1200, 1250, 1450)`, and test what the layer is for rather than that it is non-empty: 1000 is single-line stream only, so a filter built on it draws no large river.

### terra: `focal(na.rm = TRUE)` drops NA cells from the vote, so where you fill NA around a filter changes its output
Fill NA with the value you mean (`ifel(is.na(x), 0L, x)`) **before** a `focal()` majority or min/max filter, not after it, whenever those cells should count.

### `terra::plot()` and `plotRGB()` draw at most 500,000 cells, so a large raster's thin features break up
Pass `maxcell = terra::ncell(r)`, or draw with `rasterImage()` at one cell per device pixel, whenever a figure's point is a thin feature.

### lidR's `rasterize_terrain()` masks every cell beyond the points' hull by default, whatever `extrapolate` says
Pass `shape = "bbox"` (or a polygon) to `rasterize_terrain()` when the DTM must cover the whole window.

### A plain difference of two DEMs can hide a half-cell shift between them
Before calling two DEMs the same surface, regress their difference on the reference's gradient, or difference them at each half-cell shift.

### A nodata value written to PNG comes back from magick as alpha
Read a PNG that terra or GDAL wrote with `magick::image_convert(magick::image_read(f), matte = FALSE)`: their nodata becomes a tRNS chunk, which magick reads as alpha.

# Code Check Conventions
Structured checklist for reviewing diffs before commit.

*Index only: each rule's heading and first sentence. The full text is soul's `conventions/code-check.md`; read it before writing or reviewing code in its area. `/code-check` loads it in full.*

## Mechanisms
Fourteen shapes that keep producing bugs.

### A guard that fails toward pass
A check decides whether to do something consequential — cut a tag, run a migration, report a sweep clean.

### A fixture that cannot reach the failure mode
Hand-picked fixtures test the cases you thought of.

### A proxy is not the property
A condition that stands in for the thing you actually want.

### Verification that reads its own output
A check whose reference was produced by the thing it checks cannot disagree with it.

### A guard's scope, escape hatches, and remedies
Every guard grows the things that silently disable it.

### A fix lands in one of two callers that share a harness
Two entry points over one library, two workflows over one action, two scripts sourcing one shell lib.

### Restore the bug and prove the guard fires
A test that stays green against the code it was written to reject is decoration, and reading it will not tell you.

### A shared working tree, and what generators leave in it
A working tree has one checked-out branch.

### A wrapper's exit is not the work
A wrapper reports its own exit.

### Zero-length, empty, and unset are three different things
`paste0(character(0), "x")` is `"x"` — one phantom row from an empty frame.

### The probe is broken before the world is
When an ad-hoc probe reports that long-shipped code is broken, the prior belongs on the probe.

### Written data outlives the fix
Changing the writer changes nothing already written.

### Serialization loses meaning silently
Set `na=` and `null=` explicitly on every writer, because a serializer's default for no value is usually a valid-looking value (`"NA"`, `{}`, `'None'`) that every schema check accepts.

### One fact derived twice
A count taken from one artifact and the things counted produced from another, with a guard comparing the two.

## Rules that stand alone
General, and not an instance of a mechanism above.

### Do not edit files a long test run is reading
- `devtools::test()` (and most runners) load each test file **when they reach it**, not at launch.

### Test a persistent change through its per-process override first
A setting that is changed once and persists — `xcode-select -s`, a git config key, a registered default, an installed symlink — usually has an environment variable or flag that overrides it **for one process**.

### Adopting Existing Config
When importing config from one location into a canonical one (legacy `~/.bash_profile` → dotfiles repo, old script's env → repo, another project's `settings.json` → soul):

### Test the cold/create path of idempotent code, not just the warm no-op
- Idempotent provisioning code (a resolver-file writer, a config installer, a "create unless present" block) has two paths: the **cold** path that actually creates/writes, and the **warm** path that detects "already present" and skips.

### Fetch an expiring credential just before its first use, not at job start
Put the step that fetches short-lived credentials immediately before the first step that uses them.

### Do not write to an artifact a human is testing on
- Handing someone a deployed thing to test — a synced project, a staging database, a preview build — and then continuing to push changes into it makes two writers for one artifact.

### Percent-encode a URL at construction, not at consumption
- A URL built by string-concatenation from filenames inherits whatever those filenames contain.

### A preview flag is only safe if it previews
- `--dry-run`, `DRY=1`, `--plan` conventionally mean "show me what would happen".

### Bare `y`, `n`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no` are booleans in YAML 1.1
- The YAML 1.1 core schema resolves `y`, `Y`, `n`, `N`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `true`, `false` (and their case variants) to **booleans**.

### Documentation Staleness
- Moving/renaming scripts: update CLAUDE.md, READMEs, usage comments

### An ordered dispatch makes severity ordering load-bearing, and nothing enforces it
A `CASE`, an `if/elif` chain, or any first-match dispatch that reports a *verdict* carries an unwritten invariant: every serious arm precedes every advisory one.

### A link to a repo-hosted artifact must be *tracked*, not merely present
When the published site **is** the repository — GitHub Pages serving `docs/`, or a `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL — the question "does this file exist" is the wrong predicate.

### An assertion that matches an interpolated value cannot see the claim around it
`expect_error(f(x), "some_column")` looks like it pins the guard.

### A pluralisation marker takes the quantity of whatever was substituted last
`cli`'s `{?a/b}` reads the most recent quantity in the string, and **any** substitution resets it — including a length-1 one that is not what the marker is about.

## Security

### Process Visibility
- Secrets passed as command-line args are visible in `ps aux`

### Secrets in Committed Files
- `.tfvars` must be gitignored (contains tokens, passwords)

### Firewall Defaults
- `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH is world-open — document if intentional

### Credentials
- Passwords with special chars (`'`, `"`, `$`, `!`) break naive shell quoting

### Gitleaks pre-commit hook
Configuration patterns and false-positive handling for the `gitleaks` pre-commit hook (kdot's Brewfile ships `gitleaks` + `pre-commit`; cyclops standardizes the hook):

### "Public bucket" ≠ listable: GetObject vs ListBucket
- A bucket policy granting only `s3:GetObject` on `bucket/*` makes exact-key fetches public but NOT listing — and dataset discovery (`arrow::open_dataset()`, duckdb globs, STAC `/vsicurl/` directory reads) requires `s3:ListBucket` on the **bucket ARN** (no `/*`; it's a bucket-level action).

## Spreadsheets and PDFs

### A stored value is not wrong just because the raw number looks wrong
Before reporting that a spreadsheet value is off by a factor, check the cell's **number format**.

### Verify PDF links from the annotations, not the extracted text
`pdftotext` returns anchor text, not the href.

### Extracted PDF text carries corrupted glyphs, and a tolerant parser turns them into wrong numbers
Never strip non-digits to clean a number extracted from PDF text: corrupted glyphs (an `O` for a `0`, a Private Use Area micron sign) become plausible wrong values, so anchor on the label and check against an independent identity.


# NGE Feature Workflow

For non-trivial issue-driven work, follow this checklist. Each step exists for a reason — skipping leads to rework, broken builds, and avoidable bugs that we've hit repeatedly.

## The Sequence

1. **Start with `/planning-init <N>`** — given an issue number, enters plan mode for codebase exploration, presents a phase breakdown for user approval, then scaffolds branch + PWF baseline with the approved phases. One command replaces the manual issue → explore → plan → branch → scaffold dance.
2. **Write robust tests first** — failing tests that reproduce the issue or document the new behavior. Tests are the contract; they fail until the work makes them pass.
3. **Name with intent** — functions, parameters, internal helpers carry the naming style of the package they live in. Look at existing exports as the guide; consistency over cleverness. For files rather than functions — shell scripts and operational R scripts under `scripts/` or `data-raw/` — the standard is the `noun_verb-detail` pattern in `newgraph.md`, noun first.
4. **Examples that run** — every exported function gets a runnable `@examples` block. Pkgdown renders them; CI executes them. An example that doesn't run is documentation rot.
5. **Code-check before it merges** — `/code-check` on the staged diff before each commit, or `/code-check branch` once over the branch before the PR ("When to Skip" below). Catches what tests miss: edge cases, hard-coded paths, unguarded variables, security issues.
6. **Atomic commits** — each commit bundles code change + checkbox flip in `task_plan.md`. The diff and the progress live in the same commit; `git log -- planning/` tells the full story.
7. **`/planning-archive` when complete** — moves PWF to `archive/YYYY-MM-issue-N-slug/`, creates a fresh `active/`. Then `/gh-pr-push` opens the PR; `/gh-pr-merge` handles the release bookkeeping.

## Where the checkpoints are not

Step 1's plan approval is the authorization for every step after it. Run steps 2–7
through to the **open PR** without stopping to report between phases — the merge in
step 7 is outside the mandate unless the instruction includes it; put the decisions that
genuinely change what gets built at the plan gate, batched, with a recommendation
first; report once when the PR is open. The rule, its boundary (before a plan
exists, a question wants an answer) and its exceptions are `agent-operations.md` §4.

## Re-read origin before you open the PR, not just before you cut the branch

Verifying local is current with origin (`code-check-shell.md`, "Before you *cut* a
branch") protects the branch point. It
says nothing about the build window, which is where a parallel session lands, and both
sessions' pre-flight checks pass.

*4 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/feature-workflow.md`.*

Before opening a PR, and again before merging:

```bash
git fetch -q origin
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main          # what landed while you worked
git diff origin/main -- DESCRIPTION NEWS.md  # a version you did not bump
```

**A version bump you did not make is the tell**, and usually the only one — the tree is
clean, the branch is healthy, and nothing in git hints that someone solved your problem
an hour ago.

On a collision, do not resolve conflicts file by file. The merge conflict hides the
useful question, which is *which body of work survives*. Ask, then re-land the delta on
top of what shipped; two independent attempts at one problem are usually complementary
rather than redundant, and a mechanical resolution keeps whichever half git preferred.

When main only moved under you, with other work and no duplicate, bring it in with
`git merge origin/main`, not a rebase: `progress.md` and the archive README cite the
branch's commit SHAs, and a rebase rewrites every one they name (2026-10-12).

## Re-read the issue body before the baseline

Re-fetch it and diff against the copy you planned from. An edit made during plan mode
is invisible to a plan built on the first read: in stac_airphoto_bc#47 the body gained
two requirements that way, caught only by the plan review after three phases had landed.

## An issue number you did not file yet is somebody else's

GitHub allocates one sequence across issues **and** PRs, on creation. So a number
written down before the issue exists — a branch name, a code comment, a config header,
a commit trailer — is a reservation nobody honours, and in an active repo it will
eventually name a real issue about something else entirely.

That is the expensive direction. A number pointing at *nothing* is obvious; a number
pointing at a **stranger's issue** resolves, renders as a link, and reads as provenance.
Nothing downstream checks that the issue it names has anything to do with the code
beside it.

*5 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/feature-workflow.md`.*

- **Cite an issue only after it exists.** If the work has no issue and does not warrant
  one, write no number: a comment that explains itself is better than a wrong pointer.
- **Before merging, resolve every issue number the branch introduces** and check the
  title is about this work — one call, and it is the only thing that separates a good
  citation from a plausible one:

  ```bash
  git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD >/dev/null   # three-dot: the branch's own changes
  git diff origin/main...HEAD | grep -oE '(^\+.*)(rtj|rfp|gq|soul|link)#[0-9]+' \
    | grep -oE '[a-z_]+#[0-9]+' | sort -u
  # then, per hit:
  gh issue view <N> --repo NewGraphEnvironment/<repo> --json title -q .title
  ```

- **Name the branch for the work when there is no issue** (`<client>-<area>-<year>`), and
  rename it once one exists — `git branch -m` before the first push costs nothing.

Sibling of the section above: both are parallel sessions moving underneath work that
looked settled when it started.

## The version lives in one place

Do not restate the current version in `README.md` or `CLAUDE.md` prose. A version
string typed into prose drifts from the moment it is written — the release step
maintains `DESCRIPTION` and `NEWS.md`, and one report repo's
`CLAUDE.md` was found eight minor versions behind, its `README.md` one behind, with both
canonical files correct. Link to `NEWS.md` instead. Where a claim genuinely must stay in
prose, `/gh-pr-merge` step 7 greps for the previous version string outside the two
canonical files and updates the prose restatements it finds, reporting each.

## When to Skip

The skip covers the **workflow**, never the **review**. Two questions, answered separately:

- **PWF, branch, archive: decided by size.** For one-line fixes, version-bump-only PRs, or
  small documentation edits, the scaffolding is overhead. Use judgment. The threshold is
  roughly: **multi-step issue, multi-file change, or anything that requires scoping** →
  use the workflow.
- **`/code-check`: not decided by size.** Every change to something that runs or is
  loaded as instructions (code, a script, a skill, a convention, config) is reviewed
  before it merges, however short it is. For a lone commit that means before the commit.
  On a PWF branch it means once over the branch's diff (`/code-check branch`), with the
  same three-round floor. Size does not predict whether a review finds something; where
  the change lands does, and a one-line edit to something every repo loads is still a
  one-line edit to something every repo loads.

Three things are exempt, each for a stated reason:

- **Whitespace, and spelling inside a single word.** Changing a word changes what a rule
  says, and one batch's wrong claims each read correctly on their own.
- **Commits a skill writes itself and gates mechanically**: `/gh-pr-merge`'s release
  bookkeeping, CLAUDE.md syncs, `CITATION.cff` refreshes.
- **Unattended skills' capture commits**: `/compact-prep` step 2's, which can carry code,
  and `/claude-memory-audit`'s `CLAUDE.md` and `research/` writes. Not covered, as each
  reaches one repo; a soul `skills/` commit on `main` is the open exception. Convention
  appends get one reviewer instead, held on a finding.

The review is the cheap half. Scaffolding costs a plan, a branch and an archive; a review
costs a few reviewer agents, and its three-round floor stays, because small edits are
exactly where its findings have come from.

*7 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/feature-workflow.md`.*

## Skills That Slot In

- `/planning-init <N>` — start
- `/planning-update` — sync checkboxes mid-session
- `/code-check` — before each commit, or once over the branch (`/code-check branch`)
- `/planning-archive` — when issue closes
- `/gh-pr-push` — open the PR
- `/gh-pr-merge` — merge with release bookkeeping

## Issue bodies get edited, not appended

When work changes what an issue should say, **edit the body**. Don't add a
comment that corrects it, and retitle when the scope moves.

**Why:** an issue is read as a spec by whoever picks it up. A body saying one
thing with a comment three screens down saying the opposite costs the reader the
reconciliation, every time.

**How to apply:** `gh issue view N --json body -q .body` into a file, revise,
`gh issue edit N --body-file`. Name what changed and why when the correction is
load-bearing — the goal is a body that reads correctly top to bottom, not an
erasure of history. Comments are for genuine commentary: a merge notice, a
cross-repo pointer, a question. Applies to PR bodies too. Commit messages are
immutable history and are never rewritten this way.

**The failure mode that keeps recurring: research findings feel like
commentary.** They are not — they are the spec. If a finding changes what
someone would *build*, it belongs in the body, with the durable version in
`research/` and the body linking to it. What `research/` holds, how a file is
named and what its header carries is `planning.md`, "`research/` — what is
known, outliving the issue that found it".

**Bodies drift at the moment work finishes, not while it is in flight.** Four
instances in a single day of rfp work, all of the same shape — the code learned
something and the issue did not:

| drift | what a reader saw |
|---|---|
| premise disproved by measurement | an issue arguing for a fix that was no longer needed |
| a conclusion asserted in the body but never landed in code | body and tree contradicting each other |
| the shape of the work moved during exploration | a spec describing a design nobody built |
| a decision made and shipped, body still listing options A–D | "decision needed" on a decision a year old |

Vigilance does not catch this, because the drift happens exactly when attention
moves to the merge. `/gh-pr-merge` reconciles at that moment — see its step 3b.

## Work owed between two open issues stays in both bodies

A task whichever PR merges second must do stays in both issue bodies until it is done, and
the merge that does it ticks both copies. Never write "moved to #M": a move bets on a merge
order nobody has decided. `/gh-pr-merge` 3b re-reads the other issue before writing a pointer to it.

## Public-repo text describes the package, and points nowhere private

In a public repo, issues, PRs, comments, commit messages, NEWS and roxygen describe
behaviour **in terms of the package's own inputs and conditions**. Our machines, tunnels,
ports, local env files and private repos stay out, with the two exceptions below. Check
where the text lands before you draft it, naming the destination: with no argument, `gh`
reports the repo the session stands in, which reads private when you file from a private
repo into a public one.

```bash
gh repo view <owner>/<repo> --json nameWithOwner,visibility --jq '"\(.nameWithOwner): \(.visibility)"'
```

**Why:** a public package is a tool for anyone who installs it. "On our dev box the
tunnel on port N is down" tells an outside reader nothing about the package, and it
publishes our setup. A link to a private repo 404s for everyone outside the
organisation, and it names internal work as it does so.

**How to apply:**

- **Restate an infrastructure-only repro as its general condition.** "Credentials are
  set and the server is unreachable, so the test errors instead of skipping" is the bug.
  Which host it happened on is not. Propose a general mechanism, such as gating on a
  reachable connection, not a workaround for one setup.
- **Host names, tunnels, ports and local env files** (`~/.Renviron` and its like) stay in
  private repos or machine-local notes. A public repo's `planning/` is committed, so it
  is public too. One exception: where the machine is the subject of a measurement, such
  as a benchmark between hosts or a run log named for the host that produced it, its
  label stays. The setup around it still goes.
- **No links to private repos, and no `owner/private-repo#N`, not even as provenance.**
  Describe the dependency in words ("work on a downstream estimate is in progress"), or
  leave it out.
- **One exception: the R&D tracking cross-reference.** `/gh-pr-push` writes it into PR
  bodies, resolved from the tracking issues' titles. It stays: it is deliberate claim
  tagging, and the only private pointer this rule allows.
- **A scrub covers the surfaces you were editing; re-grep the others before merging.** The
  issue body is drafted at plan time and the code later, so scrubbing the tree and the PR
  body leaves the body untouched. `/gh-pr-merge` step 3b is the moment to grep it, then
  read it for the bare names a grep misses.
- **A leaked body is recreated, not edited: GitHub shows its edit history to anyone.** A fresh
  issue with no discussion is deleted (`gh issue delete`, admin) and refiled clean, the private
  side in a private-repo issue. Where the number must stay, edit it, then delete each older
  revision in the web UI (the "edited" menu); the API cannot. GraphQL `userContentEdits` lists
  the revisions. A leaked title stays in its `RenamedTitleEvent`, so only deleting the issue
  removes it. A private repo flipping public meets this for every body at once, before the flip.
- **A public repo's `CLAUDE.md` is contributor text, and it is still public.** Package-level
  setup, such as which env vars the connection helper reads and how live tests skip, stays.
  Our host topology does not: which machine runs what, cross-host ssh recipes, tunnel ports.
  Write those as a generic example, or keep them in machine-local memory. The
  conventions synced below the marker are generated, so fix a private reference in them
  at their source, never in place; soul's `check_public_render.sh` fails on one there.

This is the public-repo half of the rule that keeps project and client identifiers out of
public text. Both apply wherever the destination is public, whichever repo the session is
running in.

# LLM Behavioral Guidelines

<!-- Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/main/CLAUDE.md -->
<!-- Last synced: 2026-02-06 -->
<!-- These principles are hardcoded locally. We do not curl at deploy time. -->
<!-- Periodically check the source for meaningful updates. -->
<!-- Only the upstream guidelines live here. NGE's own operating rules, once sections 5-8 of this file, are in agent-operations.md. -->

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.


# pkgdown Publishing

What a pkgdown deploy puts on the public internet, and the two ways that has
already gone wrong.

## A pkgdown site publishes every root-level markdown file

`pkgdown:::package_mds()` renders **every** `.md` in the package root except a
hardcoded allowlist — `README`, `LICENSE`, `NEWS`, and two GitHub templates.
There is **no config option to exclude a file**.

So `CLAUDE.md` gets published. So would `INTERNAL.md`, `NOTES.md`, or a PWF
`task_plan.md` left at the root.

**Repo visibility does not protect you.** GitHub Pages serves publicly
regardless of whether the repo is private, and there is no private Pages mode
below Enterprise Cloud. A private repo with a pkgdown deploy has public docs.

Measured 2026-08-23: `CLAUDE.html` was live on six NGE sites. On `rfp` and `gq` —
both private repos, so their `CLAUDE.md` legitimately carried the internal-only
conventions — that put the SR&ED section on the public web: claim structure,
field code, fiscal year, and the consultant by name.

The visibility filter was working correctly the whole time. It rests on an
assumption pkgdown breaks: that a private repo's `CLAUDE.md` stays private.

Pages from a private repo's **branch root** goes further and publishes the repository itself.
With `main` `/` as the source and legacy Jekyll building it, the repository's files are served,
`CLAUDE.md`, `planning/`, `research/` and `comms/` among them. Serve a site from `/docs` or `gh-pages`, and
check a private repo's Pages source with `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages --jq .source`:
`gh-pages` at `/` is the built site, the default branch at `/` is the repository.

*4 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/pkgdown-publishing.md`.*

### Remove it before the build, not after

There are three copies, not one:

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.html` | the rendered page |
| `CLAUDE.md` | a **verbatim copy of the source**, served as-is |
| `search.json` | the full-text index, containing the text |

Deleting `docs/CLAUDE.html` after the build leaves the other two. It looks like a
fix and achieves nothing. Remove the file from the CI checkout **before**
`build_site()` runs:

```yaml
- name: Keep internal notes out of the published site
  run: rm -f CLAUDE.md
```

### Gate on a declared allowlist

Each repo states which extra root pages it *intends* to publish. Anything else
fails the build, so a new root markdown file cannot leak silently:

```yaml
- name: Fail if an unexpected page reached the site
  run: |
    allowed="404 authors index LICENSE LICENSE-text"   # + declared extras
    ...
```

Add to `allowed` only after deciding the page should be public. `link` publishes
`NOTICE` and `RUNBOOK` deliberately — it is a public repo and both are genuine
documentation. That is the decision the allowlist is meant to record.

Test the gate against **both** known answers before shipping it: it must exit
non-zero on a site that does contain the file, and zero on one that does not. A
guard that only ever returns one value is indistinguishable from a broken one.

## Deploy with `clean: true`

`JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action` defaults matter here. With
`clean: false`, the action **never deletes** — every file ever deployed stays on
`gh-pages` forever, whether or not the source still produces it.

Two consequences, both observed:

- Removing a file from the repo does **not** unpublish it. Measured on `gq`:
  `task_plan.html`, `progress.html` and `findings.html` were still returning 200
  long after the PWF documents had been moved out of the root.
- A leak cannot be fixed by fixing the build. The stale copies need a separate
  explicit purge, which is a step people forget.

`clean: true` makes the deployed site equal to what the build produced, so
removing a file from source removes it from the web on the next deploy. That is
the property you want, and it makes the site auditable.

### Check before flipping it

`clean: true` deletes anything on `gh-pages` not present in `docs/`. Confirm
none of these exist first:

- **`CNAME`** — a custom domain file would be deleted and the domain would break.
  (NGE repos have none; the domain comes from the org site repo, and project
  sites inherit it as subpaths.)
- **`dev/`** — versioned docs from `development: mode: devel`, if the deploying
  build is not the dev one.
- **hand-added assets** not produced by the build. Favicons and web manifests
  under `pkgdown/favicon/` *are* produced by the build and are safe.

Use `clean-exclude` for anything that must survive.

```bash
gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/contents?ref=gh-pages" --jq '.[] | "\(.type) \(.name)"'
```

## Removing something already published

1. **Stop generating it** — the pre-build removal above.
2. **Remove the deployed copy** — automatic once `clean: true` is in; otherwise
   an explicit purge.
3. **De-index** — a Search Console removal request per property, *after* the URL
   404s.

Do **not** add a `robots.txt` block first. Blocking crawl prevents crawlers from
seeing the 404, which keeps stale search entries alive longer than doing
nothing.

`gh-pages` history is not a problem the way normal git history is: on a private
repo the branch is not publicly browsable, and only the currently-served content
is public. Deleting the file genuinely ends the exposure — no history rewriting.

## pkgdown drops a footnote's body and keeps its marker

A pandoc footnote — `text[^k]` with a `[^k]: …` block — renders in an article as a
**superscript marker with no footnote section under it**. The marker is emitted
(`class="footnote-ref"`), the content is not, and nothing warns.

So the failure is silent and lands on exactly the material a footnote is for: the caveat, the
definition, the reconciliation. Measured 2026-09-06 in drift#66, where a footnote carrying the
reconciliation of two circulating hectare totals — the sentence that stops a reader treating them
as a disagreement — was absent from the published page while `rmarkdown::render()` of the same
source showed it fine.

- **Do not write footnotes in a pkgdown article.** Promote the content to a block quote, a
  parenthetical, or its own short paragraph. If it is worth a footnote it is usually worth being
  visible.
- **Check the rendered HTML, not the source.** The tell is a marker with nothing to jump to:

  ```bash
  grep -c 'footnote-ref' docs/articles/<name>.html     # markers emitted
  grep -c 'class="footnotes' docs/articles/<name>.html # section emitted — expect these to agree
  ```

Same family as the cross-reference gotcha already noted for vignettes (`\@ref(fig:…)` compiling
to a literal): bookdown output formats do not carry all of bookdown's machinery through pkgdown,
and each missing piece fails quietly in its own way. Verify anything structural — footnotes,
cross-references, numbered captions — against the built page the first time you use it.

## Tables in an article: a footnote goes through kableExtra on an HTML kable

Write a table that needs a note as `knitr::kable(x, format = "html", caption = ) |>
kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) |> kableExtra::footnote(general = , general_title = "")`,
with `kableExtra` in `Suggests`. A pandoc footnote is dropped (above), and a note long enough to
need one does not belong in the caption. Both pieces matter: `footnote()` on a bare `kable()`
numbers the caption twice ("Table 2: Table 3:") and writes `NA` into the table's `style`
attribute, and adding `kable_styling()` without `format = "html"` still doubles the caption.

# Planning Conventions

How Claude manages structured planning for complex tasks using planning-with-files (PWF).

## When to Plan

Use PWF when a task has multiple phases, requires research, or involves more than ~5 tool calls. Triggers:
- User says "let's plan this", "plan mode", "use planning", or invokes `/planning-init`
- Complex issue work begins (multi-step, uncertain approach)
- Claude judges the task warrants structured tracking

Skip planning for single-file edits, quick fixes, or tasks with obvious next steps.

## The Workflow

1. **Explore first** — Enter plan mode (read-only). Read code, trace paths, understand the problem before proposing anything. When the work codifies a pattern that already exists in multiple places (reference implementations across repos), read **every** reference in full, not just the canonical one — variation across references surfaces patches before v0.1 instead of as churn later (measured: reading all 4 references preempted 5 of the 7 fixes a dry-run would have found). Don't substitute Explore-agent summaries for direct reads; agents sometimes report existing files as absent.
2. **Plan to files** — Write the plan into 3 files in `planning/active/`:
   - `task_plan.md` — Phases with checkbox tasks
   - `findings.md` — Research, discoveries, technical analysis
   - `progress.md` — Session log with timestamps and commit refs
3. **Plan-review with the Plan agent — concurrently, not as a gate** — Once `task_plan.md` is scaffolded, spawn the Plan subagent (`Agent({subagent_type: "Plan", prompt: "..."}`) and ask it to critically review the task_plan against the issue body + actual codebase. Categorize findings as Blocker / Gap / Ordering / Assumption / Scope / Acceptance. The agent reads files fresh — it catches what you miss when you've been thinking about the design too long.

   **Do not wait for it.** Spawn, then start the lowest-risk phase. Background agents have repeatedly returned late — in one case after the entire issue had shipped — so treating the review as a precondition stalls the work for as long as the agent takes (see `agent-operations.md` §2). Fold findings in whenever they land: pre-baseline they edit the plan; mid-implementation they become follow-up commits — unless the finding is a stored-data fork of the kind `agent-operations.md` §4 reserves for the user. A review that arrives after the code is written is not wasted — the reviewer reads real code instead of a plan, which is how one late review still contributed three fixes that no earlier reading had found. If you genuinely cannot proceed without the result, run it with `run_in_background: false` so the blocking is explicit.

   Verify before acting, in both directions. Findings have been confidently wrong (a "BLOCKER" disproved by a 30-second probe) and confidently right about things nobody suspected. Reproduce the claim first.

   **"Both directions" includes the reviewer's conclusions, not just its findings.**
   A review is wrong in the *alarming* direction loudly — a BLOCKER you probe and
   disprove costs one round-trip. It is wrong in the *reassuring* direction
   silently, because nothing prompts you to check a sentence telling you that you
   are finished. Treat *"this is now terminal / complete /
   definitional"* as a claim with an author, exactly like an issue asserting a
   question can only be answered by testing.

   Corollary on when to stop: **convergence is not a reviewer saying you have
   converged.** End on an enumeration of the complete candidate set showing nothing
   sits above its source, not on another round.

   **Spawn review agents UNNAMED.** Passing `name` to the `Agent` tool changes what you get: a named spawn becomes a persistent *teammate* that goes **idle** rather than completing, so there is no final report to auto-deliver and its output must be pulled with `SendMessage`. An unnamed spawn is a fire-and-return subagent whose report arrives on its own in the completion notification. Pass `name` only for a collaborator you intend to keep messaging, and shut it down when done — it pings indefinitely otherwise.

   That mis-spawn produced one of the silent-delivery failures below, so check `name` before suspecting settings. Teammate mode (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` + `teammateMode`, merged globally from `soul/settings/defaults.json`) shapes what a *named* spawn becomes; it is not by itself why findings go missing, and an unnamed spawn delivers fine with it enabled.

   **Get the findings into a file — but check who is doing the writing.** Message delivery can fail silently, by idle pings with no content or by routing to another session. From this side an idle ping is indistinguishable from an agent that had nothing to say, so the loss is invisible. A file (`planning/active/review-<N>.md`) survives routing, survives the agent exiting, and is greppable later. One path per **spawn**: a replacement gets its own, because the original may still deliver into the one it was given, and a missing file reads as a lost review only after the completion notification or the deadline in `agent-operations.md` §2, "Don't trust status".

   **The `Plan` and `Explore` agent types have no Write tool, so they cannot write that file.** Asked to, they return the review as reply text instead. So:

   - **Read-only agent** (`Plan`, `Explore`): ask for the findings **in the reply**, then write them to `planning/active/review-<N>.md` yourself. The file is still the deliverable; you are just the one creating it.
   - **Agent type that can write**: put the file-path instruction in the first prompt, not as a follow-up.

   Asking for a file the agent cannot produce costs a round-trip, and — worse — sets you up to read an absent file as an absent review. Check the agent type's tools before writing the instruction.

   **A reviewer asked to prove a guard fires will patch your working tree, and that races
   your own test runs.** "Restore the defect and watch it go red" is the right instruction
   (`code-check.md`), and a subagent given it edits the same files the parent is testing.
   From the parent's side the result is a test run that reports failures belonging to
   nobody's code — the reviewer's planted defect, caught mid-flight. Tell reviewers to work
   in a copy (`cp -r` to a temp dir, or a worktree) and say so in the prompt; they honour it
   when asked. Then snapshot the files you care about and `cmp` them before **and after**
   every run whose result you intend to act on, so "the tree was intact for this
   measurement" is a fact rather than an assumption. Same hazard as a mid-flight edit in
   `agent-operations.md` §1, arriving from an agent instead of from you.

   **A copy protects the files, not where a script writes or the CPU.** A copied script
   still writes where its paths point (an absolute path from anywhere; a relative one or
   `here::here()` when it runs from the repo), so name each output variable to redirect and have the reviewer confirm the
   substitution matched before it runs. And time nothing while a reviewer is probing: start
   a benchmark after its completion notification, or tell it to read and not run code.

   **Review the fixes, not just the code.** The second pass is where the value concentrates, because a fix written under a wrong assumption reproduces the same defect. **Convergence is the signal to stop, not a fixed number of rounds.**

   Convergence is measured, not felt — a quiet round and an exhausted reviewer look
   identical. What terminates a review is to **enumerate the
   candidate set mechanically and show nothing sits above its source of truth**: parse
   the files and walk every `cli_abort`/`warning`/`stop` rather than recalling them, so
   "all of them are pinned" is a count. For the guards a fix introduced, the equivalent
   instrument is a mutation table (`code-check.md`, "Restore the bug and prove the guard
   fires"). `code-check.md` states the enumeration rule under "A guard's
   scope, escape hatches, and remedies" — terminate by enumeration, not by a reviewer
   saying you have converged. `/code-check` treats three rounds as the floor and keeps
   going while a round finds a defect inside the previous fix.

   Ask for the **mechanism**, not more instances, such as an invariant enforced by two lists happening to agree.

   The thing reviewers catch that self-probing does not is **interop**. Ask the consumer.

*31 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/planning.md`.*

4. **Lock naming before the baseline** — If naming feedback surfaces during planning (legacy filename, inconsistency with an existing file family), fold the rename into the convention + task_plan BEFORE the baseline commit, not as a follow-up. Pre-baseline it's free; retrofitting after implementation cascades (measured: `build_exec_pdf.R` → `run_pagedown_exec_summary.R` locked in pre-baseline meant zero downstream rework).
5. **Commit the plan** — After Plan-agent review + fixes. This is the baseline.
6. **Work in atomic commits** — Each commit bundles code changes WITH checkbox updates in the planning files. The diff shows both what was done and the checkbox marking it done.
7. **Code check before commit** — Run `/code-check` on staged diffs before committing, or once over the branch with `/code-check branch` before the PR (`feature-workflow.md`, "When to Skip"). Per commit, don't mark a task done until its diff passes review. In branch mode each commit still carries its own checkbox flip (Atomic Commits, below), the Validation box for `/code-check` is the one that waits for the branch review, and its fixes land as follow-up commits.
8. **Archive when complete** — Move `planning/active/` to `planning/archive/` via `/planning-archive`. Write a README.md in the archive directory with a one-paragraph outcome summary and closing commit/PR ref — future sessions scan these to catch up fast. Where the work produced measurements, that README is also the evidence record; see below.

## The archive README is the measurement record

Debugging and benchmarking sessions are systematic investigation: a stated unknown, an
experiment, a number, a conclusion, and usually two or three informative dead ends. That
is SRED evidence, and it scatters — into PR bodies, issue comments, and log files whose
names encode a timestamp and nothing else. In six months the chain *we did not know X,
we measured Y, therefore Z* survives only in a chat transcript.

**The archive README is where that chain lives.** Not a separate run record: the PWF
triple already holds every part of it — the question in `task_plan.md`'s frame, the
method in `progress.md`, the numbers in `findings.md`, the dead ends in its "Errors
Encountered" table. A second document would restate all of it and be half-populated.
The README is the index over them.

So an archive README for work that produced measurements carries two more sections:

```markdown
## Measurement

<host-a> 0.0391 vs <host-b> 0.0872 min/1k segments — hosts are 2.23x apart.
Moved the provincial estimate 5.0 h -> 4.3 h and changed how work packs across machines.

## Evidence

`data-raw/logs/study_area_run/20260831_19*` — four spins, one defect each.
```

Three rules on those sections:

- **Numbers carry units, and say what changed because of them.** A measurement nobody
  acted on is still worth recording if it turned an assumption into a number — say that
  too. "Confirmed the expected" is a real outcome.
- **Cite a prefix or glob, never a file list.** A list rots the moment a run is re-run;
  a prefix survives. This is why campaign subdirectories exist (`newgraph.md`, "Which
  logs to commit").
- **Keep the wrong turns.** A diagnosis made, retracted on a bad inference, then
  confirmed by measurement *is* the evidence of systematic investigation. Sanitising it
  into a tidy conclusion destroys exactly what makes the record worth keeping.

**The case this does not cover.** Measurement that predates an issue has no PWF to
attach to — `/planning-init` takes an issue number, and exploratory runs often *produce*
the issues rather than follow them. That measurement belongs in the issue or PR it
spawned, with the log directory's own README as the index. Do not build a third system
to close this gap. The *finding* it settles goes where every settled finding goes —
`research/`, next section — which is not a third record of the run but the one place its
verdict is kept current.

## `research/` — what is known, outliving the issue that found it

Three homes, one job each: **the PWF archive is the story, committed logs are the
measurements, `research/` is the durable verdict** — floodplains' `research/README.md`
had that framing before this section existed. A research file holds what is now *known*: a
settled method, a measured fact about an external system, a search that established an
absence — so that someone picking the work up months later does not re-derive it.
`planning/archive/<issue>/` holds what was *done*, in order, for one issue, and is rarely
opened by anyone who never saw that issue. The research file is the one they will look for.

What does **not** go there: a work log; a run record (Run / Hardware / Software /
Configuration blocks — that is the archive README's `Measurement` and `Evidence`, above);
the raw numbers (committed logs). A living document revised as knowledge moves is the shape
that moves the state of knowledge; a dated run record duplicates the archive.

*5 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/planning.md`.*

### One topic file, revised in place — git is the version record

`research/<topic>.md`, noun-first, **no date in the filename**. A new measurement that
changes what is known revises the topic file; it does not add a dated sibling.
`git log --follow research/<topic>.md` is the dated history, the archive README it cites
is the *why*, and the logs are the numbers — everything an R&D claim needs, with no second
copy of any of it.

Existing dated files — `20260711_…`, `…_2026_05_25.md` — are **not renamed**. They are
cited by path from `CLAUDE.md` files and from other conventions (`bookdown.md`,
`agent-operations.md` §3), and a rename breaks the citation the way it breaks log evidence
(`newgraph.md`, "Which logs to commit"). Convergence is forward-only, and the README says
when.

### The header is the provenance, in prose

No research file in any repo carries YAML frontmatter and nothing consumes it, so
provenance is one line under the H1. floodplains' is the shape to adapt — it already carries
the date and the issues, and names its log prefix in the body:

```markdown
**Date opened:** 2026-07-11 · **Issue:** #8 · **drift:** 0.6.0 (`dft_stac_fetch(tile_size=)`,
drift#36) · **Status:** OPEN — design set, runs pending.
```

Three things the line must carry — `**Verified:** <date> · **Issues:** … · **Produced by:** …`
is the minimal form:

- **When it was last true.** The file's date, and a section-level date wherever one
  section is re-verified alone. A research file whose numbers cannot be re-derived ages
  into folklore, and one that states a scope or a quantity drifts silently when the code
  moves — three link documents, two of them research files, asserted a recompute "runs over
  every WSG in the schema" after two commits had changed it (`agent-operations.md` §3, "Documents
  that share an ancestor corroborate nothing"). When code changes a behaviour a research
  file describes, grep `research/` for the sentence. Files written before 2026-09-06 gain
  the line when next revised; no fleet sweep is required.
- **What produced it.** The script path or log prefix for a measurement; the source list or
  reference-manager collection for a literature review. Never a number without its producer.
- **Which issues it came from and which it spawned.** The issue body links the research
  file (`feature-workflow.md`, "Issue bodies get edited, not appended"); the research file
  names its issues; and an archive README whose `Measurement` was distilled into a research
  file links it. Both ways, every time — one direction leaves the other end unfindable.

### The directory carries a README

An index: one row per file, what it covers — rfp's is the model. Where other repos hold
related work, a "Related work" list of links. Where two naming patterns coexist, the
cutover line in the form `newgraph.md` uses for logs:

```markdown
Naming: `<topic>.md`, revised in place, from 2026-09-06.
Files dated before that carry a `yyyymmdd_` prefix; they are not being renamed.
```

The README is the index. `CLAUDE.md` links the README once and cites an individual file
only where a rule depends on it. Twenty-three topic files with no README and a `CLAUDE.md`
citing four of them by path — link, measured 2026-09-06 — is the state this prevents.

### R packages and public repos

`research/` is top-level and excluded from the tarball: `^research$` in `.Rbuildignore`
(`code-check-r.md`, "`R CMD build` ships every top-level directory not in
`.Rbuildignore`"). Not `inst/notes/` or `inst/research/`, which ship inside the installed
package — the three packages carrying those (eight files, 2026-09-06) migrate by issue,
forward-only. In a package, `research/` is also where durable reference notes go, because
`docs/` belongs to pkgdown and `inst/` ships. And a public tool repo's `research/` is
public: report findings from internal work aggregated, never by the names of who it was for.

## Atomic Commits (Critical)

Every commit that completes a planned task MUST include:
- The code/script changes
- The checkbox update in `task_plan.md` (`- [ ]` -> `- [x]`)
- A progress entry in `progress.md` if meaningful

This creates a git audit trail where `git log -- planning/` tells the full story. Each commit is self-documenting — you can backtrack with git and understand everything that happened.

## File Formats

### task_plan.md

Phases with checkboxes. This is the core tracking file.

```markdown
# Task: <issue title> (#<N>)

<issue body — Problem section if present, otherwise first paragraph>

## Phase 1: [Name]
- [ ] Task description
- [ ] Another task

## Phase 2: [Name]
- [ ] Task description
```

Mark tasks done as they're completed: `- [x] Task description`

### findings.md

Append-only research log. Discoveries, technical analysis, things learned.

```markdown
# Findings

## [Topic]
[What was found, with source/date]

## Errors Encountered

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
```

### progress.md

Session entries with commit references.

```markdown
# Progress

## Session YYYY-MM-DD
- Completed: [items]
- Commits: [refs]
- Next: [items]
```

## The Reboot Test

The planning files exist so the work survives an interruption. Whether they
actually do is checkable: at any point mid-task, these five questions must be
answerable from the files alone, without the conversation.

| Question | Answer source |
|----------|---------------|
| Where am I? | Current phase in `task_plan.md` |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases in `task_plan.md` |
| What's the goal? | The `# Task: <title> (#N)` frame and problem statement at the top of `task_plan.md` |
| What have I learned? | `findings.md` |
| What have I done? | `progress.md` |

If an answer lives only in the session, **write it down and commit it**. Written
is not sufficient: an uncommitted `findings.md` does not move between machines,
and a repo whose `planning/` is gitignored accepts `git add planning/` with exit
0 while tracking nothing — see Directory Structure below.

This is the operational check for the rule that every interruption should be a
resume point: a session death, sleep, or machine swap should cost a re-run at
most, never lost context. That rule states the goal; this tests it.

Run it before any long wait, before compaction, and before switching machines —
the moments that take a session without warning. `/compact-prep` and
`/planning-update` are where it gets run; this section is what it asks.

## Directory Structure

```
planning/
  active/          <- Current work (3 PWF files)
  archive/         <- Completed issues
    YYYY-MM-issue-N-slug/
```

If `planning/` doesn't exist in the repo, run `/planning-init` first.

**`planning/active/` must be tracked, not gitignored.** The atomic-commit rule
above requires each commit to carry its own checkbox flip in `task_plan.md`; an
ignored `active/` drops it silently, so `git log -- planning/` shows archives
appearing fully-formed with no history behind them. In-flight PWF also stops
surviving a move between machines.

The failure is quiet in both directions. `git add planning/` reports nothing and
exits 0 on an ignored path, and files tracked *before* the rule existed keep
being tracked — including through a `git mv` into the ignored directory. So a
repo can look like it is working right up until the first genuinely new PWF file,
which simply never appears in a commit.

Check rather than assume:

```bash
git check-ignore -v planning/active/task_plan.md   # expect no output
```

*3 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/planning.md`.*

## When Something Keeps Failing

Before a second attempt, name the failure class. A **deterministic** failure
returns the same result to the same inputs, so re-running unchanged only spends a
turn — change the inputs or change the approach. A **transient** failure
(network, a provider read, a rate limit, a resource still settling) is the case
where a re-run *is* the attempt: `code-check-infra.md` prescribes exactly that for a
tofu plan that falsely reports a resource deleted. The rule is not "never retry";
it is never retry unchanged while expecting a different answer.

Escalate rather than iterate once the approach itself is in question. Report what
was tried and the exact error, and hand over the commands to run — the user is
assumed to be away, so a question answerable from a phone beats a retry loop they
cannot see. Escalating is not stopping: commit the current state, then move to
the lowest-risk independent part of the plan while the question is outstanding.

Two classes escalate immediately rather than after retries, because further
attempts make them worse:

- **A clamped session.** Once a live credential has been read, later
  system-mutating commands are refused regardless of route — seven consecutive
  refusals across unrelated routes is the documented case (`newgraph.md`,
  "Reading a secret clamps the rest of the session"). Trying more phrasings is
  the failure mode, not the remedy, and `/permissions` does not clear it.
- **Rate limits.** Retrying extends the block (`ci-monitoring.md`).

### Log the errors that cost a retry

An error that took more than one attempt to get past goes in `findings.md`, so
one task does not hit the same wall twice:

```markdown
## Errors Encountered

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `fatal: Unimplemented pathspec magic '_'` | Long-form `:(exclude)path` |
```

That row is also what graduation looks like: it began as one task's blocker and
now lives in `code-check-shell.md` as a general rule about pathspec magic. Most rows
never make that trip and should not — the ledger's job is to stop one task
repeating itself.

When a failure does generalize, it graduates to the convention that owns its
class: the `code-check*.md` family for a bug class in a diff — `code-check.md` for a
mechanism, `-shell`, `-r`, `-python`, `-spatial` or `-infra` for a tool quirk — `ci-monitoring.md` for CI
behaviour, the domain convention otherwise.

## Skills

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/planning-init` | First time in a repo — creates directory structure |
| `/planning-update` | Mid-session — sync checkboxes and progress |
| `/planning-archive` | Issue complete — archive and create fresh active/ |

# Python Conventions
How New Graph Environment repos declare and run Python, the sibling of `r-packages.md`.

*Index only: each rule's heading and first sentence. The full text is soul's `conventions/python.md`; read it before writing or reviewing code in its area.*

### Declare dependencies in `pyproject.toml` and commit `uv.lock`
A repo whose Python is a package, or whose scripts import a shared module of the repo's own, declares its dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, commits the `uv.lock` that `uv lock` writes, runs through `uv run`, and adds no `environment.yml`.

### A loose script carries its dependencies inline
A standalone script that imports no module of the repo's own declares its third-party imports in PEP 723 inline metadata and runs with `uv run --script`; one that imports only the standard library needs none.

### Two exceptions, each named in the repo's `CLAUDE.md`
Conda stays where a conda-forge binary that has no wheel is load-bearing, and PyQGIS scripts declare nothing, because QGIS's own interpreter runs them.

### Never `conda run -n` an environment the repo does not declare
A script that runs `conda run -n <env>` against an environment declared in no file of its own repo cannot run from a fresh clone, so declare the dependencies here instead.


# R Package Development Conventions

Standards for R package development across New Graph Environment repositories.
Based on [R Packages (2e)](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.

**Reference packages:** When starting a new package, study these existing
packages for patterns: `flooded`, `gq`. They demonstrate the conventions below
in practice (DESCRIPTION fields, NEWS.md style, pkgdown setup, test structure,
hex sticker, etc.). README layout is `readme.md`, with `link` as its worked example.

## Style

- tidyverse style guide: snake_case, pipe operators (`|>` or `%>%`)
- Match existing patterns in each codebase
- Use `pak` for package installation (not `install.packages`)
- Prefer `fs::` helpers over base R for filesystem path operations in build
  scripts and scaffolds: `fs::dir_create()` (creates parents by default, no
  `recursive`/`showWarnings` fiddliness), `fs::path()`, `fs::file_delete()`,
  `fs::file_exists()`, `fs::path_file()`. Avoids cross-platform separator
  issues and silent no-ops on empty paths.
- Prefix column name vectors with `cols_` for discoverability in the
  environment pane: `cols_all`, `cols_carry`, `cols_split`, `cols_writable`.
  Same principle for other grouped vectors (`params_`, `tbl_`, etc.)
- For SQL DDL+INSERT pairs that share a schema, use a single named
  vector as the source of truth. Both `CREATE TABLE` and
  `INSERT (cols) SELECT cols` derive their column lists from the same
  `cols_*` vector. Avoids drift between table shape and write
  projection — when columns change, you edit one place. Example:
  ```r
  cols_streams <- c(
    id_segment           = "integer NOT NULL",
    watershed_group_code = "varchar(4) NOT NULL",
    geom                 = "geometry(MultiLineStringZM, 3005)"
    # …
  )
  # CREATE TABLE consumes both names + types
  ddl_body <- paste(names(cols_streams), unname(cols_streams), sep = " ",
                    collapse = ", ")
  # INSERT consumes names only
  proj <- paste(names(cols_streams), collapse = ", ")
  ```

## Package Structure

Follow R Packages (2e) conventions:
- `R/` for functions, `tests/testthat/` for tests, `man/` for docs
- `DESCRIPTION` with proper fields (Title, Description, Authors@R)
- `DESCRIPTION` URL field: include both the GitHub repo and the pkgdown site
  so pkgdown links correctly (e.g., `URL: https://github.com/OWNER/PKG,
  https://owner.github.io/PKG/`)
- `NAMESPACE` managed by roxygen2 (`#' @export`, `#' @import`, `#' @importFrom`)
- Never edit `NAMESPACE` or `man/` by hand

## One Function, One File

Each exported function gets its own R file and its own test file:
- `R/fl_mask.R` → `tests/testthat/test-fl_mask.R`
- Commit the function and its tests together
- Use `Fixes #N` in the commit message to close the corresponding issue

## GitHub Issues and SRED Tracking

### Issue-per-function workflow

File a GitHub issue for each function before building it. This creates a
traceable record of what was planned, built, and verified.

### Branching for SRED

For new packages or major features, work on a branch and merge via PR:

```
main ← scaffold-branch (PR body carries the R&D tracking cross-reference)
```

This gives one PR that contains all commits — a single SRED cross-reference
covers the entire body of work. Individual commits within the branch close
their respective function issues with `Fixes #N`.

### Closing issues

Close function issues via commit messages — see Closing Issues in newgraph conventions.

## Testing

- Use testthat 3e (`Config/testthat/edition: 3` in DESCRIPTION)
- Run `devtools::test()` before committing
- Test files mirror source: `R/utils.R` -> `tests/testthat/test-utils.R`
- Test for edge cases and potential failures, not just happy paths
- Tests must pass before closing the function's issue
- Always grep for errors in the same command as the test run to avoid
  running twice:
  ```bash
  Rscript -e 'devtools::test()' 2>&1 | grep -E "(FAIL|ERROR|PASS)" | tail -5
  ```
  For error context: `grep -E "(ERROR:|FAIL )" -A 10 | head -25`

### Common pitfalls

- **`cli::cli_alert_warning()` is not `warning()`.** It's visual only —
  callers can't catch it with `withCallingHandlers(warning = ...)` and
  testthat's `expect_warning()` won't fire. When a function offers a
  `warn` mode that callers may want to react to programmatically, use
  `warning()`. Reserve `cli_alert_warning()` for FYI messages with no
  programmatic contract.

- **`expect_match(x, ..., all = FALSE)` passes silently on `character(0)`.**
  If the input is empty (e.g. no warnings fired), the assertion succeeds
  vacuously and defeats the test. Always pair with
  `expect_gt(length(x), 0)` first when input may be empty.

- **`skip_on_cran()` does not skip on GitHub Actions.** It skips when
  `NOT_CRAN` is unset — and `devtools`, `usethis`'s check workflow and
  `r-lib/actions` all set `NOT_CRAN=true`, precisely so your tests *do* run in
  CI. So a network test guarded only by `skip_on_cran()` runs on every push,
  and any upstream hiccup reddens the build for a reason unrelated to the
  change under review.
  - Use **`skip_on_ci()`** for a test that is meant for a human's machine — a
    live canary against a third-party service, something slow, anything whose
    failure needs a person to interpret it.
  - `skip_if_offline()` is not a substitute: it tests whether the network is
    reachable, not whether the *service* is behaving, and it calls
    `skip_if_not_installed("curl")`, so add `curl` to Suggests or the guard
    itself is what breaks.
  - Read the guard, not the comment above it.

- **`testthat::test_file()` does NOT set `NOT_CRAN`, so re-running one file to
  diagnose a failure can execute none of it.** The mirror of the rule above, and
  the more dangerous direction: `devtools::test()` sets `NOT_CRAN=true`, so a
  `skip_on_cran()`-guarded test runs there and fails; re-running that same file
  with `testthat::test_file()` to investigate reports `SKIP` and looks like
  exoneration.

  ```
  devtools::test()                 -> [ FAIL 1 | PASS 4495 ]
  testthat::test_file("that.R")    -> [ FAIL 0 | SKIP 6 ]   Reason: On CRAN
  NOT_CRAN=true testthat::test_file("that.R") -> [ FAIL 0 | PASS 259 ]
  ```

  Only the third line is evidence. Prefix `NOT_CRAN=true` on any single-file re-run, or
  read the SKIP count rather than the FAIL count.

*4 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/r-packages.md`.*

- **`local_mocked_bindings(.package = )` needs testthat >= 3.2.0.** A package
  pinned at `testthat (>= 3.0.0)` errors rather than skipping on an older
  install. Bump the pin when you first mock another package's binding.

## Examples and Vignettes

### Runnable examples on every exported function

Examples are how users discover what a function does. They must:
- **Actually run** — no `\dontrun{}` unless external resources are required
- **Use bundled test data** via `system.file()` so they work for anyone
- **Show why the function is useful** — not just that it runs, but what it
  produces and why you'd use it
- **Use qualified names** for non-exported dependencies (`terra::rast()`,
  `sf::st_read()`) since examples run in the user's environment

### Vignettes

At least one vignette showing the full pipeline on real data:
- Demonstrates the package solving an actual problem end-to-end
- Uses bundled test data (committed to `inst/testdata/`)
- Hosted on pkgdown so users can read it without installing

What a vignette says, and in what order, is `writing.md`.

**Output format:** Use `bookdown::html_vignette2` (not
`rmarkdown::html_vignette`) for figure numbering. Requires `bookdown` in
Suggests and chunks must have `fig.cap` / `caption =` for numbered
figures and tables.

**Gotcha — cross-references don't resolve in vignettes.** `Table \@ref(tab:foo)`
and `Figure \@ref(fig:foo)` markers compile to a literal `\@ref(...)` in
the rendered HTML rather than a numbered link. Bookdown's cross-ref
machinery isn't fully wired through `html_vignette2` under pkgdown.
Use natural language instead — "the table below", "the floodplain map",
"the parameter table" — and let the captions speak for themselves. If
you need real numbered cross-refs, use `bookdown::html_document2`
(matches the cd-style report-appendix pattern) and accept that the
output is no longer a true package vignette.

**Vignettes that need external resources (DB, API, STAC):** Do NOT use
the `.Rmd.orig` pre-knit pattern — it breaks `bookdown` figure numbering
because knitr evaluates chunks during pre-knit and emits `![](path)`
markdown that bookdown can't number.

Instead, separate data generation from presentation:
1. `data-raw/vignette_data.R` — runs the queries, saves results as `.rds`
   to `inst/testdata/` (or `inst/vignette-data/`)
2. Vignette loads `.rds` files, all chunks run live during pkgdown build
3. A comment in the vignette's setup chunk names the script: `# data from data-raw/script.R`
4. bookdown controls all chunks — figure numbers, cross-refs work

Then keep the vignette and its bundle true as both move:

1. **Run the code the vignette shows.** The `data-raw/` script runs each `eval = FALSE`
   recipe as written and refuses to bundle unless it returns the bundled values.
2. **A recipe readers copy works on a fresh machine:** it installs what it loads
   (`code-check-r.md`, "duckdb in R: the query that autoloads `icu`…").
3. **Check every number the prose quotes** with a `stopifnot()` in the chunk that computes
   it, so the build fails when the data no longer supports the sentence.
4. **Prove a refactor did not move the numbers:** render before and after, strip the HTML
   to text, and diff. Only the prose you meant to change differs.
5. **The bundle carries provenance**, the commit and date it was built at, which the
   vignette prints. A regeneration forced by a script change asserts every other element
   `identical()` to the old bundle; rebuild where it was built when values pass through BLAS.
6. **Install the branch before building an article whose bundle changed.** pkgdown renders
   articles against the installed package, so `system.file("vignette-data", …)` reads the
   installed copy's bundle, while `rmarkdown::render()` after `pkgload::load_all()` reads
   the source tree's: the same article can pass one way and fail the other.

*13 lines of evidence for this rule are in `conventions/r-packages.md`.*

### Test data

- Created via a script in `data-raw/` that documents exactly how the data
  was produced (database queries, spatial crops, etc.)
- Committed to `inst/testdata/` — small enough to ship with the package
- Used by tests, examples, and vignettes — one dataset, three purposes

## Documentation

- roxygen2 for all exported functions
- `@import` or `@importFrom` in the package-level doc (`R/<pkg>-package.R`)
  to populate NAMESPACE — don't rely on `::` everywhere in function bodies
- pkgdown site for public packages with `_pkgdown.yml` (bootstrap 5)
- GitHub Action for pkgdown (`usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")`)

## lintr

Run `lintr::lint_package()` before committing R package code. Fix all warnings — every lint should be worth fixing.

### Recommended .lintr config

```r
linters: linters_with_defaults(
    line_length_linter(120),
    object_name_linter(styles = c("snake_case", "dotted.case")),
    commented_code_linter = NULL
  )
exclusions: list(
    "renv" = list(linters = "all")
  )
```

- 120 char line length (default 80 is too strict for data pipelines)
- Allow dotted.case (common in base R and legacy code)
- Suppress commented code lints (exploratory R scripts often have commented alternatives)
- Exclude renv directory entirely

## Dependencies

- Minimize Imports — use `Suggests` for packages only needed in tests/vignettes
- Pin versions only when breaking changes are known
- Prefer packages already in the tidyverse ecosystem

## Releasing

1. Update `NEWS.md` — keep it concise:
   - First release: one line (e.g., "Initial release. Brief description.")
   - Later releases: describe what changed and why, not function-by-function.
     Link to the pkgdown reference page for details — don't duplicate it.
   - Don't list every function; the pkgdown reference page is the single
     source of truth for what's in the package.
2. Bump version in `DESCRIPTION` (e.g., `0.0.0.9000` → `0.1.0`) — as the **final** commit of the branch, after verification numbers/tests are final. Mid-branch bumps are premature and churn: additional code changes end up bundled inside a "release" that already claimed the version.
3. Commit as "Release vX.Y.Z"
4. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push && git push --tags`

## Repository Setup

### Branch protection

Protect main from deletion and force pushes:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets --method POST --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "name": "Protect main",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "bypass_actors": [
    { "actor_id": 5, "actor_type": "RepositoryRole", "bypass_mode": "always" }
  ],
  "conditions": { "ref_name": { "include": ["refs/heads/main"], "exclude": [] } },
  "rules": [ { "type": "deletion" }, { "type": "non_fast_forward" } ]
}
EOF
```

### Scaffold checklist

- `usethis::create_package(".")`
- `usethis::use_mit_license("New Graph Environment Ltd.")`; `Authors@R` as in `/citation-cff`
- `usethis::use_testthat(edition = 3)`
- `usethis::use_pkgdown()`
- `usethis::use_directory("dev")` — reproducible setup script
- `usethis::use_directory("data-raw")` — data generation scripts
- Hex sticker: copy soul's `templates/make_hexsticker.R` to `data-raw/`
- CI: copy soul's `templates/R-CMD-check.yaml` and `templates/pkgdown.yaml` (callers of `NewGraphEnvironment/flows`) to `.github/workflows/`
- Set GitHub Pages to serve from `gh-pages` branch

### dev/dev.R

Keep a `dev/dev.R` file that documents every setup step. Not idempotent —
run interactively. This is the reproducible recipe for the package scaffold.

## README

What a README says, in what order, and what stays out of it is `readme.md`, which loads
wherever this file does.

## LLM Workflow

When an LLM assistant modifies R package code:
1. Run `lintr::lint_package()` — fix issues before committing
2. Run `devtools::test()` with error grep — ensure tests pass in one call:
   ```bash
   Rscript -e 'devtools::test()' 2>&1 | grep -E "(FAIL|ERROR|PASS)" | tail -5
   ```
3. Run `devtools::document()` and grep for results:
   ```bash
   Rscript -e 'devtools::document()' 2>&1 | grep -E "(Writing|Updating|warning)" | tail -10
   ```
4. If the repo has a `_pkgdown.yml`, run `Rscript -e 'pkgdown::check_pkgdown()'`
   after adding or removing an export. A new export missing from the reference
   index is an **error**, not a note, so it reddens the pkgdown workflow after
   the PR is already open — the check costs a second locally and saves the round
   trip. (Adding to the index is usually right; `@keywords internal` is the
   alternative it names.)
5. Check `devtools::check()` passes for releases — capture results in one call:
   ```bash
   Rscript -e 'devtools::check()' 2>&1 | grep -E "(ERROR|WARNING|NOTE|errors|warnings|notes)" | tail -10
   ```

# Writing a README
A README tells a stranger what a package is, why it is worth their time, and how to try it, in that order and in the fewest words that stay true.

*Index only: each rule's heading and first sentence. The full text is soul's `conventions/readme.md`; read it before writing or reviewing code in its area.*

### Open with what the package is and why it is valuable, not with a list of features
Open with one to three sentences on what the package is, what data it works on, and why that is valuable, naming the restoration decision it informs where there is one.

### Write the tagline, the description field, the GitHub About and the opening together
Change the README tagline, the DESCRIPTION `Title` (or pyproject `description`) and the GitHub About text together so they say the same thing, and keep the `Description` field and the README opening in step.

### Show a little code and its real output, a figure of real output, or both
Show the package working instead of listing what it can do: a figure of real output where it is spatial or visual, a short example with its real printed output, or both.

### Describe nothing that is not fully built
Leave out every capability that has not shipped, including partly built ones and those framed as a target, a next iteration or a roadmap; add each one when it ships.

### Check each claim against the code path a run takes
Before publishing a README sentence, find the code path a real run takes for it, and check that each "every", "each", "both" or plural holds for every member of its set.

### Sections run in a fixed order
Order a README as: name, hex sticker, a lifecycle badge while unstable, and tagline; the opening; the figure; Installation; the example; Learn more; Ecosystem; Data and methods it builds on; Citation, License and NOTICE.

### State development status with a lifecycle badge, not a warning in the prose
Mark an unstable installable package with a lifecycle badge under the title, and after the install command say that functions change between releases, link NEWS, and show how to pin one.

### A README figure of output is made by committed code
Make every README figure of the package's output from a committed script that runs on real data, check it at its published width, give it alt text and a short caption saying what it shows, and style a map through gq.

### Leave out what another file already keeps
Leave out roadmaps, changelogs, function tables, version strings in prose, counts of published things, and internal hosts or private repos, because each is kept elsewhere and goes stale in a README.


# Reference Management Conventions

How New Graph Environment's technical writing cites its sources. The Zotero mechanics (which
routes work, adding items and PDFs, Better BibTeX key timing, reading `zotero.sqlite`, finding a
PDF) are in `/zotero-api` section 0, `/zotero-lookup` and `/lit-search`, which load when that work
happens.

## Citation keys are BBT-auto-derived

**Never set `Citation Key:` in the `extra` field.** BBT honours it as a manual override,
and that breaks the convention that every key follows one formula: stable, reproducible,
the same key for the same paper on every collaborator's machine. Leave `extra` empty, or
use it only for other Zotero-supported fields (`Original Date:`, `tex.shorttitle:`).
Ten items created with hand-set keys in one lit review (cd#58, 2026-05-05) had to be
PATCHed clean after the user caught it.

A key is unique within one library, not across them: 12 of 327 keys shared between
libraries named different works, so resolve a key within its library. Key timing, the corporate-author guard and the BBT/Zotero version pairing are in
`/zotero-api` section 0. Our own reports are the one exception: they are not Zotero items, and
their key is the repository name (below).

## In Reports (bookdown)

### Bibliography generation

```yaml
# index.Rmd — dynamic bib from Zotero via Better BibTeX; the filter drops local `file` paths
bibliography: "`r rbbt::bbt_write_bib('references.bib', overwrite = TRUE, filter = function(b) gsub('[[:space:]]+file = [{][^}]*[}],?', '', b))`"
```

`rbbt` pulls from BBT, which syncs with Zotero. Edit references in Zotero → rebuild report → bibliography updates.

**Library targeting:** rbbt must know which Zotero library to search. This is set globally in `~/.Rprofile`:

```r
# default library — NewGraphEnvironment group (libraryID 9, group 4733734)
options(rbbt.default.library_id = 9)
```

Without this option, rbbt searches only the personal library (libraryID 1) and won't find group library references. The library IDs map to Zotero's internal numbering — use `/zotero-lookup` with `SELECT DISTINCT libraryID FROM citationkey` against the BBT database to discover available libraries.

Set `options(cred.zotero_library = "NewGraphEnvironment")` in the same `~/.Rprofile`, so cred's audit and store builds read the library the bibliography cites. Without it, a key present in two libraries warns and resolves to nothing. cred takes the group name rather than a libraryID because the internal number can differ between machines (cred#40).

### Citation syntax

- `[@key2020]` — parenthetical: (Author 2020)
- `@key2020` — narrative: Author (2020)
- `[@key1; @key2]` — multiple
- `nocite:` in YAML — include uncited references

### Cite primary sources

When a review paper references an older study, trace back to the original and cite it. Don't attribute findings to the review when the original exists. (See LLM Agent Conventions in `newgraph.md`.)

**When the original is unavailable** (paywalled, out of print, can't locate): use secondary citation format in the prose and include bib entries for both sources:

> Smith et al. (2003; as cited in Doctor 2022) found that...

Both `@smith2003` and `@doctor2022` go in the `.bib` file. The reader can then track down the original themselves. Flag incomplete metadata on the primary entry — it's better to have a partial reference than none at all.

**Check what a source says before citing it:**
- NEVER write abstracts manually — if CrossRef has no abstract, leave blank
- NEVER cite specific numbers without verifying from the source PDF via ragnar search
- NEVER paraphrase equations — copy exact notation and cite page/section

## In articles (pkgdown)

An article's citations follow `writing.md`, "Name, link and cite the software": a `.bib` written by
script from the Zotero group library and the packages' own `citation()`, pandoc author-year
citations, and a `::: {#refs}` list. Every literature reference an article cites is in the group
library first.

## Our own reports

A New Graph report is cited from its own repository's `CITATION.cff`, the one record every
citation of it is rendered from.

- **The record:** the top level carries `title`, `authors`, `date-released`, `url` (the published
  site, `https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/<repo>/`) and `repository-code`. `preferred-citation`
  repeats them with `type: report`, `institution: {name: New Graph Environment Ltd.}`, `year` and
  `date-published`: CFF allows only `software` or `dataset` as the top-level `type`, and cffr gives
  a `@TechReport` only with `year` and `institution`.
- **The title is the report's public name** (the website's link text), not the cover, which can
  carry grant codes. **The date is that of the build being published:** the template's build
  sets the record's dates on every gitbook render, so they are never typed by hand.
- **The key is the repository name** (`[@<repo>]`): unique, stable, and
  free of the stem collisions Better BibTeX gives a series of same-titled reports.
- **DOI:** each publication of a public report is a GitHub release (`/gh-pr-merge` cuts one for a
  repo whose `DESCRIPTION` carries a version), archived by Zenodo. The concept DOI is written once,
  as `Config/DOI` in the report's `DESCRIPTION`, and the build copies it into the `.cff`. A repo
  Zenodo does not archive yet carries no `doi`.
- **A report cites a package** by `writing.md`, "Name, link and cite the software", **and another
  of our reports** through `references-newgraph.bib`, which the template builds from each cited
  report's public `CITATION.cff` (`params$cite_reports`). Those keys go to rbbt's `ignore =`, so
  Zotero is never asked for them.

# Writing for the Reader
Anything an outside reader sees answers their questions in their order and carries nothing that served only its authors.

*Index only: each rule's heading and first sentence. The full text is soul's `conventions/writing.md`; read it before writing or reviewing code in its area.*

### Headings are the reader's questions, in the order they ask them
Make each heading a question the reader brings, in their order, within any sections a report template fixes; in a data product's article, limits and validation go last.

### Open with the answer
State the finding, with its numbers, in a sentence or two before any method, so a reader who stops there has the right answer.

### Orient the reader in one sentence per place
Say where each place is by the river it joins and the nearest town with a compass direction, checked against the Freshwater Atlas, and show the places on regional maps with keymaps.

### Write each article to stand alone
Never use a sibling article as the reference point: describe each method, bar and comparison on its own terms, and carry the sentence the reader needs rather than the sibling's figure or paragraph.

### Define a term in its own place, before it is used
Give a term the article depends on its own short section before its first use, with its rule, why it exists, and how many cases fall each way.

### Prefer a plain phrase to a term
Name a quantity by what it does for the reader ("the score; lower is better"), and keep a term only if the article reuses it, giving it its own place.

### Species common names in lower case
Write chinook salmon, coho and steelhead in lower case in prose and captions: it is our house style.

### Choose the form that lands with the reader
Pick a sentence, table, figure or map by which one tells the reader the story fastest, and judge it by its effect on the reader, not by a preference for prose.

### A sentence beside a table says what it shows, never what it holds
Say the pattern beside a figure or table and leave its values to it: restated medians, shares and month names are read twice, and a statistic the table does not hold has no source on the page.

### A caption names every mark the figure draws
When a figure gains a mark, its caption gains a phrase, or the new mark reads as one the caption already names.

### Define, read and cite every statistic you name
Give every statistic an article names, at the table that carries it, what it compares, how to read its values, a source, and a published rating scale beside the values where one exists.

### Cut what serves the authors
Remove what the authors needed and the reader does not: parity with superseded products, paths to internal research, and how a decision was reached.

### State a weakness as what the product does, not what the reader should do
Describe each weakness in one sentence about what the product does, with no advice on working around it beyond the product's own rule.

### State each claim by the code's definition
Describe a set the code defines by that definition, never by its best-known member or a nearby proxy, or the sentence and its guard cover the proxy, not the set.

### Check that each guard covers the set its sentence names
Give each claim a guard over the whole set its sentence names, at the precision written, and re-read the guard whenever the sentence moves or is reworded, as "State each claim by the code's definition" asks of the sentence.

### When explaining a decision, list every check and the way it points
Count the checks from the data, not the conclusion, give each its direction, and call a choice the evidence did not make a decision.

### Name, link and cite the software
Cite every package an article uses inline at its first mention, ours included, data to its publisher and each claim to the page that says it, from one `.bib` of Zotero entries and the packages' own `citation()`.

### Measure the simplification
Report word and line counts before and after a rewrite, against the forecast, and name what set the floor.

### Lead with what the product does and why it matters
Open every public piece with what the product does for the reader and why it matters, before anything about how it was made.

### Let visuals carry the story where they land better
Put the story in a map, figure or table whenever the reader takes it in faster there than from prose, and keep the prose to what the visual cannot say.

### Cut any number or caveat that does not change what the reader understands
Drop a number, a precision or a caveat that leaves the reader's understanding of the product where it was, because detail the reader does not need walls them off.
